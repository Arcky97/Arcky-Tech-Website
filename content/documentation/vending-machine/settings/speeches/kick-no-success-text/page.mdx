  How to use and define various KickNoSuccessText speeches.
</Header>

The `KickNoSuccessText` determines what the Vending Machine will say when kick is not or half successful (1 or more items remained stuck).
<br/>
As shown in the example below, you can include multiple variations. The script will randomly choose one line from the array each time the player interacts with the Vending Machine Event.
<br/>
To define the `KickNoSuccessText`, use this structure:

```ruby 
KickNoSuccessText: [
  "{1} {2} dropped down and {3} {4} remained stuck!"
]
```
### Placeholder Reference
- `{1}` = amount of stuck items dropping down — e.g., `"1"`
- `{2}` = stuck item's name (singular or plural) if any — e.g., `"Potion"`
- `{3}` = amount of stuck items remaining stuck — e.g., `"1"`
- `{4}` = remain stuck item's name (singular or plural) if any — e.g., `"Potion"`
