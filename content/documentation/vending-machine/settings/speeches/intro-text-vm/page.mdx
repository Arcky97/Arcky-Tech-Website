  How to use and define various IntroText speeches.
</Header>

The `IntroText` determines what the Vending Machine will say when you first talk to it (i.e., at the start of the interaction).
<br/>
As shown in the example below, you can include multiple variations. The script will randomly choose one line from the array each time the player interacts with the Vending Machine Event.
<br/>
To define the `IntroText`, use this structure:

```ruby 
IntroText: [
  "Oh look, it's arcky's new \\c[10]Vending Machine\\c[0]!", 
  "Beep Boop, welcome customer. Choose the Item you would like to buy."
]
```
