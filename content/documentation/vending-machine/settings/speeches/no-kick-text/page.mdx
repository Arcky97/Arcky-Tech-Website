  How to use and define various NoKickText speeches.
</Header>

The `NoKickText` determines what the Vending Machine will say when you don't want to kick.
<br/>
As shown in the example below, you can include multiple variations. The script will randomly choose one line from the array each time the player interacts with the Vending Machine Event.
<br/>
To define the `NoKickText`, use this structure:

```ruby 
NoKickText: [
  "Looks like you don't mind wasting your {1}! ({2})"
]
```
### Placeholder Reference
