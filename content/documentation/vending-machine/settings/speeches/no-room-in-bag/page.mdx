  How to use and define various NoRoomInBag speeches.
</Header>

The `NoRoomInBag` determines what the Vending Machine will say when you have not enough room in your bag left. A part of the items can be added eventually.
<br/>
As shown in the example below, you can include multiple variations. The script will randomly choose one line from the array each time the player interacts with the Vending Machine Event.
<br/>
To define the `NoRoomInBag`, use this structure:

```ruby 
NoRoomInBag: [
  "You don't have enough room left in your Bag. Added {1} of {2} {3}."
]
```
### Placeholder Reference
- `{1}` = Amount of items added — e.g., `9`
- `{2}` = total amount of items chosen  — e.g., `"11"`
- `{3}` = item's name (plural) — e.g., `"Potions"`
