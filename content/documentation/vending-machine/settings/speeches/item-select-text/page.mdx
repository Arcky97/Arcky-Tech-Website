  How to use and define various ItemSelectText speeches.
</Header>

The `ItemSelectText` determines what the Vending Machine will say when you get the menu of items to choose from to buy.
<br/>
As shown in the example below, you can include multiple variations. The script will randomly choose one line from the array each time the player interacts with the Vending Machine Event.
<br/>
To define the `ItemSelectText`, use this structure:

```ruby 
ItemSelectText: [
  "Which {1} would you like to buy?", 
  "Please make your choice."
]
```
### Placeholder Reference
- `{1}` = value of `type` parameter  — e.g., `"items"`
