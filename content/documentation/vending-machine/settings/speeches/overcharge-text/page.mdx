  How to use and define various OverchargeText speeches.
</Header>

The `OverchargeText` determines what the Vending Machine will say when using an overcharge on the items.
<br/>
As shown in the example below, you can include multiple variations. The script will randomly choose one line from the array each time the player interacts with the Vending Machine Event.
<br/>
To define the `OverchargeText`, use this structure:

```ruby 
OverchargeText: [
  "Ow, you have to pay an overcharge of {1}% on all {2}s!"
]
```
### Placeholder Reference
- `{1}` = Overcharge amount — e.g., `11`
- `{2}` = value of `type` parameter  — e.g., `"item"`
