  How to use and define various ChoiceKickText speeches.
</Header>

The `ChoiceKickText` determines what the Vending Machine will say when (only if stuckChance and kickChance are given) being asked to kick the machine to get the stuck items out (eventually).
<br/>
As shown in the example below, you can include multiple variations. The script will randomly choose one line from the array each time the player interacts with the Vending Machine Event.
<br/>
To define the `ChoiceKickText`, use this structure:

```ruby 
ChoiceKickText: [
  "Oh no! {1} of your {2} got stuck! Do you want to kick the machine?"
]
```
### Placeholder Reference
- `{1}` = Amount of items stuck — e.g., `2`
- `{2}` = item's name (plural)  — e.g., `"Potions"`
