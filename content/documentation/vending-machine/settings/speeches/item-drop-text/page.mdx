  How to use and define various ItemDropText speeches.
</Header>

The `ItemDropText` determines what the Vending Machine will say when the chosen (amount of) item(s) dropped down.
<br/>
As shown in the example below, you can include multiple variations. The script will randomly choose one line from the array each time the player interacts with the Vending Machine Event.
<br/>
To define the `ItemDropText`, use this structure:

```ruby 
ItemDropText: [
  "{1} {2} dropped down!"
]
```
### Placeholder Reference
- `{1}` = Amount of items dropping — e.g., `9`
- `{2}` = Item's name (singular or plural) — e.g., `Potion`
