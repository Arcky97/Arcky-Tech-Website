  How to use and define various ItemAmountSelect speeches.
</Header>

The `ItemAmountSelect` determines what the Vending Machine will say when multiBuy is enabled.
<br/>
As shown in the example below, you can include multiple variations. The script will randomly choose one line from the array each time the player interacts with the Vending Machine Event.
<br/>
To define the `ItemAmountSelect`, use this structure:

```ruby 
ItemAmountSelect: [
  "Please choose how many {1} you would like to buy."
]
```
### Placeholder Reference
- `{1}` = Chosen item's name (plural) — e.g., `Potions`
