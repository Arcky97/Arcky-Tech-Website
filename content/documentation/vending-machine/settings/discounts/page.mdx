  How to add an apply discounts to items.
</Header>

This feature allows you to apply discounts to all items in a store.

```ruby
def someVendingMachine
  advancedVendingMachine([
    :POKEBALL, :GREATBALL,
    :POTION, :SUPERPOTION, :HYPERPOTION,
    :REPEL, :SUPERREPEL, 
    :REVIVE, 
    :ANTIDOTE, :PARALYZEHEAL,
  ], speech: "ProVend", discount: 26)
end
```

To enable discounts, add `discount:` followed by a Game Variable ID.
<br/>
You can set up discounts in three ways:

---

## First way - Game Variable + Array

Use a Game Variable and assign it an array of percentage values (e.g., `4` = 4% discount).

```ruby
Discounts = {
  26 => [0, 1, 4, 9, -11]
}
```
- `26` is the Game Variable ID.
- The array values are used base on the variable's value (treated as an index).

<Table
  headers={["Game Variable", "Discount Used"]}
  rows={[
    [0, "0%"],
    [1, "1%"],
    [2, "4%"],
    [3, "9%"],
    [4, "-11%"]
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="hint">
  Each value in the array is accessed by index. If the variable is set too high and the index doesn't exist, you'll be warned in-game.
</Callout>

## Second and Third way - Item + Game Variable(s) and Direct Value Use 

You can refer to the [discounts page](/documentation/poke-market/settings/discounts) of the poke market documentations as the setup is exactly the same.
