## Setup 

To add settings in a Vending Machine script call is very similar to how it's done in the Poké Market plugin.
- You no longer need to worry about the *order* of arguments (except for the item list, which should **always come first**).
- Here's how you'd define a Vending Machine event:

```ruby
def someVendingMachine
  advancedVendingMachine([
    :POKEBALL, :GREATBALL,
    :POTION, :SUPERPOTION, :HYPERPOTION,
    :REPEL, :SUPERREPEL, 
    :REVIVE, 
    :ANTIDOTE, :PARALYZEHEAL,
  ])
end
```

Each optional argument is explained below and in more detail on its corresponding Settings page.

---
### speech: "string"
This lets you assign a specific <Ye>Vending Machine Class</Ye> to the event.

```ruby 
  speech: "ProVend"
```

```ruby
def someVendingMachine
  advancedVendingMachine([
    :POKEBALL, :GREATBALL,
    :POTION, :SUPERPOTION, :HYPERPOTION,
    :REPEL, :SUPERREPEL, 
    :REVIVE, 
    :ANTIDOTE, :PARALYZEHEAL,
  ], speech: "ProVend")
end
```
➡️See [Vending Machine Class](settings/speeches) for more info.

---
### type: "string"
This defines the "type" of items you can buy from the Vending Machine rather than make it say "What item do you want to buy", it could say "What drink do you want to buy" if you're only selling dinkable items.

```ruby 
  type: "drink"
```

```ruby
def someVendingMachine
  advancedVendingMachine([
    :POKEBALL, :GREATBALL,
    :POTION, :SUPERPOTION, :HYPERPOTION,
    :REPEL, :SUPERREPEL, 
    :REVIVE, 
    :ANTIDOTE, :PARALYZEHEAL,
  ], speech: "ProVend", type: "drink")
end
```

---
### discount: number
Use this to apply a discount by refering a Game Variable ID:

```ruby 
  discount: 26
```

```ruby
def someVendingMachine
  advancedVendingMachine([
    :POKEBALL, :GREATBALL,
    :POTION, :SUPERPOTION, :HYPERPOTION,
    :REPEL, :SUPERREPEL, 
    :REVIVE, 
    :ANTIDOTE, :PARALYZEHEAL,
  ], speech: "ProVend", type: "drink", discount: 26)
end
```
---
### currency: "string"
Set which <Ye>currency</Ye> the Vending Machine should use.
Valid default values: 
- `"money"` or `"gold"`
- `"coins"`
- `"bp"` or `"battle points"`

<br/>
```ruby 
  currency: "battle points"
```

```ruby
def someVendingMachine
  advancedVendingMachine([
    :POKEBALL, :GREATBALL,
    :POTION, :SUPERPOTION, :HYPERPOTION,
    :REPEL, :SUPERREPEL, 
    :REVIVE, 
    :ANTIDOTE, :PARALYZEHEAL,
  ], speech: "ProVend", type: "drink", discount: 26, currency: "battle points")
end
```
---
### bonusChance: number
Set the chance the player has to receive a bonus item when buying 1 or more items from the Vending Machine. The higher the number, the higher the chance of getting a bonus item.

```ruby 
  bonusChance: 20
```

```ruby
def someVendingMachine
  advancedVendingMachine([
    :POKEBALL, :GREATBALL,
    :POTION, :SUPERPOTION, :HYPERPOTION,
    :REPEL, :SUPERREPEL, 
    :REVIVE, 
    :ANTIDOTE, :PARALYZEHEAL,
  ], speech: "ProVend", type: "drink", discount: 26, currency: "battle points", bonusChance: 20)
end
```
---
### stuckChance: number 
Set the chance the player has of an item getting stuck when buying 1 or more items from the Vending Machine. Not providing this setting will disable items getting stuck completely.

```ruby 
  stuckChance: 5
```

```ruby
def someVendingMachine
  advancedVendingMachine([
    :POKEBALL, :GREATBALL,
    :POTION, :SUPERPOTION, :HYPERPOTION,
    :REPEL, :SUPERREPEL, 
    :REVIVE, 
    :ANTIDOTE, :PARALYZEHEAL,
  ], speech: "ProVend", type: "drink", discount: 26, currency: "battle points", bonusChance: 20, stuckChance: 5)
end
```
---
### kickChance: number 
Set the chance the player's kick will be successful upon items getting stuck in the Vending Machine. This setting is only used if a stuckChance was given as well, otherwise this setting has no effect.

```ruby 
  kickChance: 80
```

```ruby
def someVendingMachine
  advancedVendingMachine([
    :POKEBALL, :GREATBALL,
    :POTION, :SUPERPOTION, :HYPERPOTION,
    :REPEL, :SUPERREPEL, 
    :REVIVE, 
    :ANTIDOTE, :PARALYZEHEAL,
  ], speech: "ProVend", type: "drink", discount: 26, currency: "battle points", bonusChance: 20, stuckChance: 5, kickChance: 80)
end
```
---
### multiBuy: `{ min: number, max: number }`
Set the minimum and maximum amount of a same item the player can buy at once. By default this would be 1 at a time when not providing this setting at all. When not providing a minimum, the default is 1. Whene not providing a maximum, the amount will be the minumum.

```ruby 
  multiBuy: { min: 1, max: 15 }
```

```ruby
def someVendingMachine
  advancedVendingMachine([
    :POKEBALL, :GREATBALL,
    :POTION, :SUPERPOTION, :HYPERPOTION,
    :REPEL, :SUPERREPEL, 
    :REVIVE, 
    :ANTIDOTE, :PARALYZEHEAL,
  ], speech: "ProVend", type: "drink", discount: 26, currency: "battle points", bonusChance: 20, stuckChance: 5, kickChance: 80, multiBuy: { min: 1, max: 15})
end
```
