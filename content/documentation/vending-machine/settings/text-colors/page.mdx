<Header title="Text Colors">
  Apply a text color for certain elements in the speeches.
</Header>

This feature allows you to change the color of the "item name" and the "money amount". You can specify a formatted color as well in the speech class as well but with this setting it always applies them by default for all stores without you needing to add the manually.

```ruby
TextColor = {
  :items => "\\c[1]",
  :money => "\\c[3]"
}
```

- `\\c[1]` will make the *Item Name* become blue.
- `\\c[3]` will make the *Money Amount* become green.
