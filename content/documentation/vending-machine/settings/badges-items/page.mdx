<Header title="Items by Badge">
  How to Limit and Item tot a certain amount of Badges.
</Header>

In default Essentials, there's not a clean way to make the Vending Machine have different items or more items depending on the Badges the player currently has.
<br/>This plugin simplifies that process witht a dedicated setting: `ItemsByBadge`.

---

### The Easy Way with `ItemsByBadge`

Use the following setup in your `000_VendingMachine_Setup.rb` file:

```ruby 
ItemsByBadge = {
  1 => [:GREATBALL, :SUPERPOTION, :ANTIDOTE, :PARALYZEHEAL],
  3 => [:HYPERPOTION, :SUPERREPEL, :REVIVE]
}
```

Each key in the hash represents a badge requirement.
<br/>Once the player has at least that many badges, the associated **items** become available for purchase.

---

### Items Available from the Start 

Any items **not listed** in the `ItemsByBadge` hash will be available by default, with 0 badges.

---

### Example Usage 

Let's say we define a Vending Machine like this:

```ruby
def someVendingMachine
  advancedVendingMachine([
    :POKEBALL, :GREATBALL,
    :POTION, :SUPERPOTION, :HYPERPOTION,
    :REPEL, :SUPERREPEL, 
    :REVIVE, 
    :ANTIDOTE, :PARALYZEHEAL,
  ], speech: "ProVend")
end
```

Now simply call `someVendingMachine` in your event using a script command.


---

### Result in Game 

🔒 With 0 Badges:

🔓 With 1 Badge:

As shown, once a badge treshold is crossed, all items defined at or below that level become available.
<br/>For example, reaching 3 badges will unlock:

```ruby
  [:HYPERPOTION, :SUPERREPEL, :REVIVE]
```
...and so on, all the way to 8 or more badges.
