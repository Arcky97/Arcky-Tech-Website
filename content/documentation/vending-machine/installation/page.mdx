## Installing the Plugin 

The installation process is very simple and is similar to how to install other plugins (not only made by me). This plugin doesn't come with any custom graphics.
<br/>
1. **Extract the ZIP file*
    <br/><Gy>Use any extractor tool (like WinRAR or 7-Zip).</Gy>
2. **Open the extracted folder and copy `Plugins` folder**
    <br/><Gy>Into your game's root directory.</Gy>
    <Callout type="warning">
      If this is your first time installing the plugin, there should be *no overwrite prompt*.
      However, if you're updating or reinstalling, **make sure to back up** your `000_VendingMachine_Setup` file, as it contains your custom settings and could be overwritten by the default one.
    </Callout>
3. **Launch your game with a new save file.**
