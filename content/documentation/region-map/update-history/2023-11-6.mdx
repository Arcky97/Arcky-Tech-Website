## v1.3.0: Customization Options

### Improvements
- The Quest Preview Graphic size will change depending on the length of the Task and Location Text.
  (According to the UI of the Modern Quest System, you're limited in text length for the Task and Location either way).
  This means that both should never exceed the limit for this plugin as well.
  - Minimum of 2 lines.
  - Maximum of 4 lines.
- The Text and Button Preview Graphic will not be hidden when the Quest Preview is active if the Position set for the Button Preview Graphic is not Top Right (default position).

### Bug Fix
- Fixed an issue when changing mode while the Quest Preview Graphic is shown.
<br/>
### New Settings
- Added a new Setting to change the Position of the Button Preview Graphic. 
  Possible positions are:
  - Top Left
  - Bottom Left
  - Top Right (default)
  - Bottom Right 
- added a new Setting to change, if preferred, the Music when opening the Region Map. (Suggested by [Alpha Zetanium XYZ](https://eeveeexpo.com/members/13752/).)
