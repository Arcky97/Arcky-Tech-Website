## v1.0.2: Bug Fixes

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed an issue that appeared when you would put "Pallet Town" in the PBS File and the game map's name is set to "Lappet Town" it'll now ignore the name of the game map's name and use the one in the PBS.
- fixed an issue with the Unvisited Map Marking appearing above the Fly Icons for locations that you can't fly to yet (unvisited).
- Fixed another issue with the Unvisited Map marking, if you put 2 points on the same location in random order (based on x and y values), it'll now take the lowest point so the Unvisited Map Graphic is placed correctly.
