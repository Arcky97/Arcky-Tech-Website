## v3.0.0: Preview Animations and Revamp
<Callout type="warning" blend="light">
  This plugin (update) no longer supports v20.1 of essentials, you'll run into crashes if you try to install it (just stick with v2.7.0)!
</Callout>
<Callout type="attention" blend="light">
  This plugin (update) now requires [Arcky's Utilities](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19xrRavd1CpbC0p1UQtOUZzuEeHL_WHB5/view?usp=sharing) v1.0.4 or higher to function correctly. Once you've installed this, start a new save to avoid malfunction.

  This update also comes with new Graphics, make sure to install those!
</Callout>
### Improvement
- The Region Map Extras are now used from the plugin settings instead of the essentials settings in the pokedex (for some reason this was never set that way while the regular region map was using the setting for the plugin itself already).
<br/>
### Bug Fixes 
- Fixed a bug with the zoom feature that when you spam the zoom trigger, the map moves slightly.
- Fixed location searching is still possible and malfunctioning while zooming is active.
- Fixed extended preview showing 1/0 pages when ExcludeMapWithNoData setting is set to true.
