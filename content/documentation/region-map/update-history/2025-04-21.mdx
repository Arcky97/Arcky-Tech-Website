## v3.1.2: Bug Fixes and Improvements
<Callout type="attention" blend="light">
  This plugin (update) now requires [Arcky's Utilities](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19xrRavd1CpbC0p1UQtOUZzuEeHL_WHB5/view?usp=sharing) v1.0.8 or higher to function correctly. Once you've installed this, start a new save to avoid malfunction.

### Improvement
- Added support for all special characters like `. , ' ( ) - _` for the Location Preview. These characters cannot be used in the constant names in the location preview setup file but only for the location name itself in the the PBS file.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed a crash with the pokedex while using Region Specific UI themes.
- Fixed the Highlight Graphics position being wrong in some cases (no clear clue why though).
