## v1.1.1: Bug Fixes and Improvements

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed an issue when the map isn't properly centered based on the player's location (when opening the region map).
- fixed an issue when the map in the pokedex isn't properly shown when the player's position is higher then 29 (x position) and 19 (y position). Thanks to [@drqiu](https://eeveeexpo.com/members/21052/) for the fix.
- fixed a type in the "highlight" folder, it's now named correctly (if you noticed this, just rename the folder, thank you)

### Improvements
- when previewing a quest, if the map can be moved upward, the arrow pointing up will now be hidden behind the quest preview graphic as long as the quest preview is shown.
- When you are inside a building or any other place you can't fly, the "ACTION: Fly" text on the top right will not be shown as you can't activate the fly mode anyways (this is when you allow to use fly on the pokegear/town map othe rthan the fly field move)x
- When you are using a map that is the standard map size (480x320), pressing USE won't do anything in the pokedex area page as you can't scroll the map anyway.
