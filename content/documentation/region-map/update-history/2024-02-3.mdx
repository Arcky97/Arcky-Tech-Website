## v2.2.0: Berry and Roaming Modes
### New Features
- Added Berry Mode with Preview and thus compability with [wrigty12's Berry Planting Improvements Plugin](https://eeveeexpo.com/resources/1410/).
- Added Roaming Mode and implemented [-FL-'s Roaming Icon on Map plugin](https://github.com/FL-/Essentials-RoamingIcon) into this plugin. So you don't need to install [-FL-'s Roaming Icon on Map Plugin](https://github.com/FL-/Essentials-RoamingIcon) for this to work.
<br/>
### Improvements
- Improved the Button Text to display depending on the Region Map being opened from the Pokegear, Fly (field move) or the Wall Map.
- Improved the handling of modes being available depending on logical conditions. For example the Quest map is not available if there are no active Quests.
<br/>
### Bug Fixes
- Fixed an issue with the Arrow (pointing upwards) not moving correctly when the Button Box is on the top left while viewing a Quest.
- Fixed an issue with the `CAN_FLY_FROM_TOWN_MAP` setting not being used.
- Fixed an issue with the button set to change Region Map not being used.

### New Settings
- Added a new Setting to set for each Region to which region you can fly to.
- Added a new Setting to set a specific location the player needs to be on to be able to fly to another region set in the setting above. (this is like in HGSS that you could only fly to kanto or johto when you were on the Indigo Plateau).
- Added a new Setting to turn the Berry Icons on or off.
- Added a new Setting to set a Button for the Berry Preview.
- Added a new Setting to turn the Roaming Icons on or off.
