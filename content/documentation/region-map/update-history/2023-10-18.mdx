## v1.1.2: Bug Fixes

### Recently Reported Issue
- The game might crash if you open the Region Map from a Game Map that has not a MapPosition defined in the map_metadata PBS file. To fix this, just make sure you have a position defined on the region map. Even if I find a work around for this issue, every single Game Map should have a position defined on the Region Map.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed an issue with the script not using the correct (or expected) unvisited map image. This issue only appears when a location is set on the top left point of a city/town. As you might set a different highlight image for the location.
- Fixed the Quest Preview not showing and disappearing properly (I fixed this but removed the animation for now)
