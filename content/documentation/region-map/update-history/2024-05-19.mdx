## v2.6.0: Extended Location Preview
<Callout type="attention" blend="light">
  This plugin now requires [Arcky's Utilities](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19xrRavd1CpbC0p1UQtOUZzuEeHL_WHB5/view?usp=sharing) to function correctly. Once you've installed this, start a new save to avoid malfunction.

  This update also comes with new Graphics, make sure to install those!
