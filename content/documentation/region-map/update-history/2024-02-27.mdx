## v2.4.1: Bug Fixes and Improvements
### Improvements
- changed the name of the setting `MINIMUM_VISITED_COUNT` to `MINIMUM_MAPS_COUNT`
- added compatibility with the Gen 8-Style Item Find Description plugin.
- when a Highlight Graphic includes "route" in the name, it's expected to be in the "Routes" folder, any other Graphic are expected to be in the "Others" folder (their name doesn't matter but still need to start with "map").
- added a counter to keep track on Static Encounters.

### Bug Fixes 
- Fixed a warning message appearing while this shouldn't be the case.
- Fixed a typo in v20.1 in the Item Tracker script.

### New Setting 
- Added a new Setting (`PROGRESS_COUNTER`). This feature was already in v2.4.0 but now this Setting allows you disable the feature when you're facing a crash. (Please still show the crash to me so i can try to find a fix for it). This is only a temporarly solution to fix the many crash reports I've received in the last week. I disabled this Progress Counter by default.
