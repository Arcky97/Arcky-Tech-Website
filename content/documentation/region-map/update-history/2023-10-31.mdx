## v1.2.1: Improvements

### Improvements
- When there's only 1 Mode available, it won't show the Button Preview Graphic and also won't play the Sound Effect when pressing the Button set to change Modes.
- When using Fly, the Text and Button to activate Quick Fly will be shown on the Top Right.

### New Setting
- You can now choose when you have 3 or more Modes to either have the Choice Menu or have the Modes change by pressing the Button set to change Modes each time.
