## v2.6.3: Region Decoration
<Callout type="attention">
  Attention: This plugin (update) now requires [Arcky's Utilities](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19xrRavd1CpbC0p1UQtOUZzuEeHL_WHB5/view?usp=sharing) v1.0.3 or higher to function correctly from now on. Once you've installed this, start a new save to avoid malfunction.

### Bug Fix 
- Fixed a bug when no MapPosition is defined (yet) and you're using the Item Progress Counter feature, it would crash the game. (This is actually a fix from the [Arcky's Utilities](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19xrRavd1CpbC0p1UQtOUZzuEeHL_WHB5/view?usp=sharing) Plugin) but it's the Region Map Plugin that caused the crash.

### New Setting 
- Added a new Setting (`REGION_MAP_DECORATION`) that allows you to add Decoration Graphics on top of your Region Map. These Graphics will render above the Highlight Images (if used). You can hide each Graphic by using a Switch. (So for example if you want some clouds to appear above an hidden Location, set it to the same switch and the clouds will dissapear while the hidden Location will appear).
