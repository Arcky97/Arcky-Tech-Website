## v2.1.1: Bug Fixes
### Improvements 
- Added an error message in the Pokedex script that tells you when there's no map metadata for a game map that you're opening the Pokedex from. This will still crash the game but at least you'll know why.
- Added a warning message when there's no Highlight Graphic defined for a location.
- Added a warning message when there's no Unvisited Graphic defined for a location (for locations that have a fly location).

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed an issue with the highlight images positions not being correctly calculated by the script (reported by sorryjzargo).
