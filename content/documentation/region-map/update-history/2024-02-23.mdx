## v2.4.0: Progress Counter
### New Feature
- You might have already noticed the Percentage showing next to the Region's Name. I've now expanded this by making it count wild pokemon, trainers and items. The only requirement for counting trainers and items is that in the events, there's either "item" or "trainer" mentioned. I'll provide some settings in a future update if you prefer to not have it count trainers, items and wild pokemon. If districts are being used, it'll split up the progress and displays it for each district respectivily.

### Improvements 
- On the Berry Mode, when you planted for example only 2 Oran Berries on the same location, it'll say that there were 2 Berries planted but it'll act like it's just 1 berry. Since it are 2 Berries of the same kind.
- On the Berry Mode, when you have more kinds of Berries planted on a same location it'll tell you, in the choice menu, how many of each kind you've planted and displays this as well on the top before the Berry name. This removes the "Total" line in the Berry preview. I might be adding a new (smaller) Graphic for just 1 line in a future update.
