## v3.1.1: Bug Fixes and Improvements
<Callout type="attention" blend="light">
  This plugin (update) now requires [Arcky's Utilities](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19xrRavd1CpbC0p1UQtOUZzuEeHL_WHB5/view?usp=sharing) v1.0.8 or higher to function correctly. Once you've installed this, start a new save to avoid malfunction.

### Improvement 

- The Player Icon will be shown on the Region Map by default. Your Region Name doesn't need to be added anymore in the `ShowPlayerOnRegion` setting. Unless you want to specifically hide it for a certain Region.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug with the Progress Counter
- Fixed a crash when a Game Map seems to be missing.
- Fixed a bug with the Map Crashing when switching Regions while only 1 Region has been visited.
- Fixed a crash with the Progress Counter being disabled while encountering a wild Pokémon.
