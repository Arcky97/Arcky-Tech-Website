## v1.1.3: Bug Fixes 

### New Setting
- Suggested by [@REALMUGEN](https://eeveeexpo.com/members/5551/): you can now have the name of a Location be replaced with "???" or whatever text you want as long as the Game Map hasn't been visited yet.

    **Important:** It is very important that the Game Map and the Point name is named exactly the same or it'll not work, it won't crash your game but instead it'll show the point's name.
  </Callout>
  You can do the same with Point of Interests on some Locations on the Region Map, you can either make these empty by doing "" or name them something else.

### Bug Fix 
- Fixed an issue with the Quest Name displaying the hidden locations on the Region Map.
