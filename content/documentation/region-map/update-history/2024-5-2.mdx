## v2.5.2: Bug Fixes
### Bug Fixes
- Fixed a crash when the available actions would happen to be 0 (this should normally never be the case though)
- Fixed a crash with the itemTracker that would crash the game when using the BW key item plugin.
- Fixed the Item Counter so it counts items given by a script command as well and not only those given by a conditional command.
