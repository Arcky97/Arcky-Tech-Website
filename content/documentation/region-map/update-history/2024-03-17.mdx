## v2.5.1: Time Based Region Maps
### New Feature 
- It's now possible to have the Region Map Image change depending on the time in game. (Feature suggested by ProChamCham).
Possible Times are:
  - Morning
  - Day
  - Afternoon
  - Evening
  - Night
- When there's no Morning, Afternoon or Evening variant, it'll use the Day variant instead.
- When there's no Night variant, it'll use the Day variant instead.
- When there's no Day variant, it'll use the Default one instead.
- When there's none at all, it'll use the default one (so better keep that one as well).

In the town_map.txt PBS, keep the name there as the default variant (for example "mapRegion0.png").
If you do not wish to use this feature, you can just ignore the console message, the map should load just fine as long as the default one is still available.

### Bug Fixes 
- Fixed a crash when confirming to fly to the chosen location using the mouse.
- Fixed the text "Change Region" on the Fly Map (field move) while you can't change the Region there.
- Fixed the District Name Feature not being used when the Progress Counter is turned off.

### New Setting 
- Added 4 New Settings, to turn on/off each individual Counter used by the Progress Counter Feature (these are the Item, Trainer, Wild Pok√©mon and Visited Location Counters).
