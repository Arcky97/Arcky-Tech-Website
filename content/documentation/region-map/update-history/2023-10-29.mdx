## v1.2.0: Improved Mode Switching

<Callout type="attention" blend="light">
  There's a new Graphic file named "mapButtonPreview.png". Don't forget to put this in the Correct Graphics Folder:
    - Graphics < Pictures < RegionMap < UI for v20.1
    - Graphics < UI < Town Map < UI for v21.1
</Callout>

### New Feature
- Added a new Feature to change between modes in style.
  - The "Button: Change Mode" text is displayed in the Mode Preview Window. It'll dissapear when Previewing a Quest.
  - 2 or less modes will change Modes directly.
  - 3 or more Modes (4 is max for now) will give you a Choice Menu to Change Modes.
    You can go from the First Mode (Normal Map) to the 4th mode (Berry Map) instead of needing to press the Button (set to change modes) 3 times and then experience the pain of having pressed too much XD.
<br/>
### Improvements
- The Mode Preview Graphic will not show on the Fly Map and Wall Map.
- When on the Quest Map and on a Position that has a Quest Icon, the "Button: Change Mode" will instead say "Button: View Quest(s)".
- When on the Fly Map and Quick Fly is enabled (either by default or by the Switch), it'll always say "Button: Quick Fly".
<br/>
**Remember that each Button can be changed in the `001_RegionMap_Settings.rb` file.**

### New Settings 
- Added a new setting to change the Button to Change Modes.
- Added a new Setting to change the Name of each Mode.
- Added a new Setting to change the Opacity of the Highlight Graphics on a Location.
