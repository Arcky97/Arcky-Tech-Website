## Example 3

Let's take a look at the Quest6 Data that comes by default with the Quest Plugin:

```ruby
Quest6 = {
  :ID => "6",
  :Name => "The journey begins",
  :QuestGiver => "Professor Oak",
  :Stage1 => "Deliver the parcel to the Pokémon Mart in Viridian City.",
  :Stage2 => "Return to the Professor.",
  :Location1 => "Viridian City",
  :Location2 => "nil",
  :QuestDescription => "The Professor has entrusted me with an important delivery for the Viridian City Pokémon Mart. This is my first task, best not mess it up!",
  :RewardString => "nil"
}
```
This Quest has just like in Example 2, more than 1 Stage. It only serves as an example, so it doesn't need to make that much sense as we'll add coordinates for the first Stage.

```ruby
:Map1 => [1, 13, 16]
```

The edited Data for Quest6 would now look like this:

```ruby
Quest6 = {
  :ID => "6",
  :Name => "The journey begins",
  :QuestGiver => "Professor Oak",
  :Stage1 => "Deliver the parcel to the Pokémon Mart in Viridian City.",
  :Stage2 => "Return to the Professor.",
  :Location1 => "Viridian City",
  :Location2 => "nil",
  :Map1 => [1, 13, 16],
  :QuestDescription => "The Professor has entrusted me with an important delivery for the Viridian City Pokémon Mart. This is my first task, best not mess it up!",
  :RewardString => "nil"
}
```

As explained in Example 2, there'll only be an Icon for Stage 1 as there's no `:Map` or `:Map2` added.

### Result in Game for Stage 1:
<ImageWithCaption src="/images/documentation/region-map/Quest Icons and Preview 9.png" align="left" caption="Quest 6 Stage 1"/>
<ImageWithCaption src="/images/documentation/region-map/Quest Icons and Preview 10.png" align="left" caption="Quest 6 Stage 1 Preview"/>

### Result in Game for Stage 2:
<ImageWithCaption src="/images/documentation/region-map/Quest Icons and Preview 11.png" align="left" caption="Quest 6 Stage 2"/>
There'll be no Icon for Stage 2 and Previewing Quest Details will also not be possible.
