## Overview
In first case, I'm talking about ThatWelshOne_'s [Modern Quest System Plugin](https://eeveeexpo.com/resources/709/).
<br/>
The Quest Icons are displayed on the Quest Mode on the Region Map.
<br/>
Make sure the `ShowQuestIcon` Setting is set to `true` or the Switch ID you set for it is `ON`.
<br/>
This will also make it possible to Preview these Quests. Which button is need to show the quest Preview is set with the ShowQuestButton Setting.
<br/>
There are a few more settings for the Quest Preview which are listed and explained in the [Quest Preview Settings](../settings/preview/quest-preview-settings) page.
<br/>
Now to make the Quest display an Icon for it, you'll need to edit the `004_Quest_Data.rb` file (of the Modern Quest Plugin). If you haven't set up any Quests for your game yet, then you should probably do that first. (Follow the instructions that come with the MQS (Modern Quest System) plugin to know how.)
