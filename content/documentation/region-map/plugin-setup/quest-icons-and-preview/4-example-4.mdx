## Example 4

Let's take a look at the Quest8 Data that comes by default with the Quest Plugin:

```ruby
Quest8 = {
  :ID => "8",
  :Name => "These boots were made for walking",
  :QuestGiver => "Musician #1",
  :Stage1 => "Listen to the musician's, uhh, music.",
  :Stage2 => "Find the source of the power outage.",
  :Location1 => "nil",
  :Location2 => "Celadon City Sewers",
  :QuestDescription => "A musician was feeling down because he thinks no one likes his music. I should help him drum up some business."
}
```
This Quest has just like in Example 2 and 3, more than 1 Stage. Just like Example 3, we'll only add the coordinates for 1 Stage.

```ruby 
:Map2 => [0, 13, 10]
```

The edited Data for Quest8 would now look like this:

```ruby 
Quest8 = {
  :ID => "8",
  :Name => "These boots were made for walking",
  :QuestGiver => "Musician #1",
  :Stage1 => "Listen to the musician's, uhh, music.",
  :Stage2 => "Find the source of the power outage.",
  :Location1 => "nil",
  :Location2 => "Celadon City Sewers",
  :Map2 => [0, 13, 10],
  :QuestDescription => "A musician was feeling down because he thinks no one likes his music. I should help him drum up some business."
}
```

As explained in Example 2, there'll only be an Icon for Stage 2 as there's no `:Map` or `:Map1` added.

### Result in Game for Stage 1:
<ImageWithCaption src="/images/documentation/region-map/Quest Icons and Preview 12.png" align="left" caption="Quest8 Stage 1"/>
There'll be no Icon for Stage 1 and Previewing Quest Details will also not be possible. (The orange Icon you see is from Quest2 Stage 3.)

### Result in Game for Stage 2:
<ImageWithCaption src="/images/documentation/region-map/Quest Icons and Preview 13.png" align="left" caption="Quest 8 Stage 2"/>
<ImageWithCaption src="/images/documentation/region-map/Quest Icons and Preview 14.png" align="left" caption="Quest 8 Stage 2 Preview"/>
<Callout type="hint">
  As you might notice, the Quest Title is a bit too long to fit on the UI. It's recommended to keep Quest Titles short.
