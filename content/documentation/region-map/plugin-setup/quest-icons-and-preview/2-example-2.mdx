## Example 2

Let's take a look at the Quest2 Data that comes by default with the Quest Plugin:

```ruby
Quest2 = {
  :ID => "2",
  :Name => "Introductions",
  :QuestGiver => "Little Boy",
  :Stage1 => "Look for clues.",
  :Stage2 => "Follow the trail.",
  :Stage3 => "Catch the troublemakers!",
  :Location1 => "Somewhere deep into Lappet Town",
  :Location2 => "Viridian Forest",
  :Location3 => "Route 3",
  :StageLabel1 => "1",
  :StageLabel2 => "2",
  :QuestDescription => "Some wild Pokémon stole a little boy's favourite toy. Find those troublemakers and help him get it back.",
  :RewardString => "Something shiny!"
}
```
This Quest Data is an extension of Example 1, it includes multiple Stages and Locations.
<br/>
To make this Quest show an Icon (when any stage of this Quest is active) on the Region Map, we add the coordinates for each stage of the Quest:
```ruby
:Map1 => [0, 13, 12, "Purple"],
:Map2 => [0, 13, 11, "Green"],
:Map3 => [0, 15,  6, "Orange"],
```
Each number after `:Map` specifies which stage this applies to.

The edited Data for Quest2 would now look like this:

```ruby
Quest2 = {
  :ID => "2",
  :Name => "Introductions",
  :QuestGiver => "Little Boy",
  :Stage1 => "Look for clues.",
  :Stage2 => "Follow the trail.",
  :Stage3 => "Catch the troublemakers!",
  :Location1 => "Somewhere deep into Lappet Town",
  :Location2 => "Viridian Forest",
  :Location3 => "Route 3",
  :Map1 => [0, 13, 12, "Purple"],
  :Map2 => [0, 13, 11, "Green"],
  :Map3 => [0, 15,  6, "Orange"],
  :StageLabel1 => "1",
  :StageLabel2 => "2",
  :QuestDescription => "Some wild Pokémon stole a little boy's favourite toy. Find those troublemakers and help him get it back.",
  :RewardString => "Something shiny!"
}
```
- If you only put `:Map` without a number then this coordinate will be applied for all stages. 
- It is also the fallback if you only add `:Map` and `:Map2` but there are 3 stages, then stage 1 and 3 will use the `:Map` and stage 2 the `:Map2`. 
- If you don't add the `:Map` and only give `:Map2` then stage 1 and other stages will have show no icon on the Region Map. (see Example 3 and 4).

The extra parameter in this example e.g., `"Purple"` specifies which icon to use for this Quest and Stage. When this parameter is not given, the default `"mapQuest.png"` Icon will be used. For `"Purple"`, the expected Icon name is `"mapQuestPurple.png"`.
<br/>
The Icons are located in:
- Graphics > UI > Town Map > Icons > Quest (v21.1)
- Graphics > Pictures > RegionMap > Icons > Quest (v20.1)

These are only example names for the Icons, name them anything you want as long as they start with `"mapQuest"` or the script will be unable to recognize them.
