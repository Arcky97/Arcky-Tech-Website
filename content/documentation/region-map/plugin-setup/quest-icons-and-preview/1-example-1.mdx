## Example 1

Let's take a look at the Quest1 Data that comes by default with the Quest Plugin:

```ruby
Quest1 = {
  :ID => "1",
  :Name => "Introductions",
  :QuestGiver => "Little Boy",
  :Stage1 => "Look for clues.",
  :Location1 => "Lappet Town",
  :QuestDescription => "Some wild Pokémon stole a little boy's favourite toy. Find those troublemakers and help him get it back.",
  :RewardString => "Something shiny!"
}
```
To make this Quest show an Icon (when the Quest is active) on the Region Map, we only need to add the coordinates for the icon to display at:

```ruby
:Map => [0, 13, 12]
```
- `0` = RegionID
- `13` = X Position
- `12` = Y Position 

The edited Data for Quest1 would now look like this:

```ruby 
Quest1 = {
  :ID => "1",
  :Name => "Introductions",
  :QuestGiver => "Little Boy",
  :Stage1 => "Look for clues.",
  :Location1 => "Lappet Town",
  :Map => [0, 13, 12]
  :QuestDescription => "Some wild Pokémon stole a little boy's favourite toy. Find those troublemakers and help him get it back.",
  :RewardString => "Something shiny!"
}
```

According to the TownMap.txt PBS file, the coordinates we set will match with "Lappet Town" in Region 0.

<Callout type="hint">
  On the Screenshot, the icon is not visible, that's because it's behind the Player's Icon. You might also have noticed that it is saying `"C: View Quest"` in the Button Preview on the top right. This is because [-FL-'s Set the Controls Screen Plugin](set-the-controls-screen) was installed. In case you don't have this plugin installed, it'll say `"USE: View Quest"` by default or the **Input Key** you've set in the [ShowQuestPreview](/documentation/region-map/settings/preview/quest-preview-settings) Setting.
