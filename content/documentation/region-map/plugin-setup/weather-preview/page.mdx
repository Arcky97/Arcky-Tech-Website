## Overview
In first case, I'm talking about [Lin's Weather System Plugin](https://eeveeexpo.com/resources/1411/).
<br/>
All required Graphics are included with the Region Map plugin. You can find them in:
- Graphics > UI > Town Map > Icons > Weather (v21.1)
- Graphics > Pictures > RegionMap > Icons > Weather (v20.1)

<Callout type="attention">
  **<Rd>The map's weather data is configured on the Weather System Plugin!</Rd>**
