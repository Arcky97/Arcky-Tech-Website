## Overview
In first case, I'm talking about [Wrigty's Berry Planting Improvements Plugin](https://eeveeexpo.com/resources/1410/
)
<br/>
If this plugin is installed, the Bery Mode can be used once a Berry has been planted on a location. With only 1 condition: You setup was done accordingly to the Guide of the Berry Planting Improvements plugin. 
<br/>
On the Berry Preview, you can then see how many Berries you've planted, which kind of Berries and the state of each Berry.
<br/>
You'll find the Berry Icons in:
- Graphics > UI > Town Map > Icons > Berry (v21.1)
- Graphics > Pictures > RegionMap > Icons > Berry (v20.1)
