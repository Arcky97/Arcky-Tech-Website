## Overview

In first case, I'm talking about [Lucidious89's Modular UI Scenes Plugin](https://eeveeexpo.com/resources/1325/).
<br/>
This plugin is fully compatible with the Region Map plugin but as it's page describes, this plugin is only for v21.1 of Essentials.
<br/>This also addes compatibility with [Lucidious89's In-Depth Pokedex Data Page Plugin](https://eeveeexpo.com/resources/1380/).

<Callout type="attention">
  When using the Modular UI Scenes plugin, make sure to use the additional Graphic required located in Graphics > UI > Pokedex > Modular UI pokedex > bg_area.png and replace the original one in the pokedex folder. **<Rd>Don't leave it in this sub folder</Rd>**
  <br/>If you don't install this additional Graphic then you'll not be seeing the Region Map in the Area Page in the pokedex.
