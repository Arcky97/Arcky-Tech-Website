## Overview 
In first case, I'm talking about [-FL-'s Set the Controls Screen plugin](https://eeveeexpo.com/resources/1038/
).
<br/>
This plugin adds an in game menu that lets you set the key bindings for the buttons used by the game. If you have installed this plugin, the Region Map plugin will show in the Button Preview the exact button to press instead of the game's named button. 
<br/>For example: "C: Show Preview" instead of "USE: Show Preview". (When the `C` key is set to USE)
