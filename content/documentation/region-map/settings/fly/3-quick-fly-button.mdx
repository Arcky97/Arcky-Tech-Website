## QuickFlyButton

Use this Setting to set which button needs to be pressed to activate the Quick Fly function while in the Fly Mode on the Region Map.

```ruby
QuickFlyButton = Input::JUMPUP
```

### Possible Values

- `Input::JUMPUP` = The Game Button.

<Callout type="hint">
  You may set this to any game button except `USE` and `BACK` because this feature can only be used on the Fly Mode of the Region Map and won't collide with any other Button Feature triggers.
