## Function of the Setting

The **Menu Settings Section** includes a single setting. It allows you to change the max number of items are shown at once in a choice menu. This might prevent the Region Map to be half covered with the choices to choose from.

```ruby 
MaxOptionsChoiceMenu = 4
```

## Possible values

- `4` = The max items shown at once in a choice menu.
