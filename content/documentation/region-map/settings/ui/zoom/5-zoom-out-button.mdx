## ZoomOutButton

Use this Setting to set which button needs to be pressed to zoom out on the Region Map while the Zoom Mode is active.

```ruby 
ZoomOutButton = Input::JUMPDOWN 
```

### Possible Values 

- `Input::JUMPDOWN`

<Callout type="hint">
  For this button, just like with [ZoomInButton](#zoominbutton), you can assign one that's been used for another feature as the Zoom Mode isolates those features. Only don't set it to the [ToggleZoomButton](#togglezoombutton) or the [ZoomInButton](#zoominbutton) or the `USE` and `BACK` buttons to avoid unexpected behavior.
