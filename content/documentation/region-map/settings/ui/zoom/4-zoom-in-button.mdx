## ZoomInButton

```ruby 
ZoomInButton = Input::JUMPUP
```

### Possible Values

- `Input::JUMPUP` = The Game Button 

<Callout type="hint">
  For this button you can assign one that's been used for another feature as the Zoom Mode isolates those features. Only don't set it to the [ToggleZoomButton](#togglezoombutton) or the `USE` and `BACK` buttons to avoid unexpected behavior.
