<Callout type="hint">
  2 things to keep in mind:
  - Your Region Map needs to be at least 512x384 instead of 480x320 in size.
  - Make sure there are no locations closer than 2 tiles (or 3 when  [CursorMapOffset](cursor#cursormapoffset) is enabled) to the edge of the Region Map as it'll be unreachable by the cursor.
