<Callout type="attention">
  The Encounter Type names it'll show in the filter are defined in the [EncounterType Setting](./preview/extended#encountertypes). If you have any custom ones, make sure to add them there so it uses the correct name, if it's missing it'll use the raw Encounter Type ID.

<Callout type="hint">
  You may set this to any game button except `USE`, `BACK` and the button you've set for `ToggleRegionSwitchButton` and `ToggleLocFilterButton`.
