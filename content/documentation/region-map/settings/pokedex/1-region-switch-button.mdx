## ToggleRegionSwitchButton

Use this Setting to set which button needs to be pressed to change the current Region in the Pokedex Area Section. You can only change to visited Regions.

```ruby 
ToggleRegionSwitchButton = Input::ACTION 
```

### Possible Values 

- `Input::ACTION` = The Game Button.
- `nil` = disabled.

<Callout type="hint">
  You may set this to any game button except `USE` and `BACK` because this would mess with default functionallity of the Pokedex.
