<Header title="Grid Settings">
  Change the size of each square used on the Region Map grid.
</Header>

## Function of the Setting 

The **Grid Settings Section** includes only two Settings. 
- `SquareWidth`: Sets the **Width** of each **Square**.
- `SquareHeight`: Sets the **Height** of each **Square**.

---

## Default Values

Both Settings are set to `16` by **default**, which is also the **recommended value**.
```ruby
SquareWidth = 16
SquareHeight = 16
```
<Callout type="attention">
  It's not recommended to change these values, as the Region Map Plugin is optimized for the default values.
