</Header>

## Function of the Setting 

The **Grid Settings Section** includes only two Settings. 
- `SquareWidth`: Sets the **Width** of each **Square**.
  <br/>*(Legacy name: `SQUARE_WIDTH`, Plugin ≤ v2.7.0 / Essentials v20.1)*
- `SquareHeight`: Sets the **Height** of each **Square**.
  <br/>*(Legacy name: `SQUARE_HEIGHT`, Plugin ≤ v2.7.0 / Essentials v20.1)*

---

## Default Values

Both Settings are set to `16` by **default**, which is also the **recommended value**.

<SetVer
  v211="SquareWidth = 16
        SquareHeight = 16"
  v201="SQUARE_WIDTH = 16
        SQUARE_HEIGHT = 16"
/>

<Callout type="attention">
  It's not recommended to change these values, as the Region Map Plugin is optimized for the default values.
