## UseRegionConnecting

Use this Setting to enable or disable the Region Connecting Feature on the Region Map. Each Region will only be visible once visited. In the map_metadata.txt and town_map.txt PBS files you should just setup the locations like they are single locations as this Feature handles everything else for you according to the [RegionConnections](#regionconnections) Setting.

```ruby
UseRegionConnecting = true
```

### Possible Values 
- `true` = Region Connecting will **<Gn>be used</Gn>**.
- `false` = Region Connecting will **<Rd>not be used</Rd>**.
