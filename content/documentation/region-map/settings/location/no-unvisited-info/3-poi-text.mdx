## P.O.I. Replace Text

This Setting may be used to set the replace name of Unvisited P.O.I. (Point of Interest) Locations.

```ruby 
UnvisitedPoiText = "???"
```

### Possible Values

The value must be a string between `" "` or `' '`.
<Callout type="hint">
  Best practice is to set it to something short and clear from the start like `"Unknown"` or `"???"`. It also don't need to be the same as the [Location Replace Text](#locations-replace-text)
