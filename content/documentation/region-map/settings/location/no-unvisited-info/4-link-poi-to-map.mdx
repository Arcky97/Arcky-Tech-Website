## Link a P.O.I. to a Map

This Setting may be used to link a P.O.I. (Point of Interest) to a Game Map. This allows you to give the P.O.I. a different name on the Region Map than the actual Game Map name. 
<br/>Not using this Setting will make the P.O.I. reveal together with the location on the Region Map.

```ruby 
LinkPoiToMap = {
  "Oak's Lab" => 4,
  "Kurt's House" => 6,
  "\v[12]'s house" => 8,
  "Cedolan Dept. Store" => 14,
  "Ice Cave" => 34,
  "Rock Cave 1F" => 49,
  "Rock Cave B1F" => 50,
  "Dungeon" => 51,
  "Diving area" => 70,
  "Cedolan City Gym" => 10
}
```

### Possible Values 

Each item you add here must exist out of a `"string"` followed by `=>` and a `Game Map ID` of the Map you want to link it to.
