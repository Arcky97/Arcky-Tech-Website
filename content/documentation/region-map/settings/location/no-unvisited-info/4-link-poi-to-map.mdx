## Link a P.O.I. to a Map

This Setting may be used to link a P.O.I. (Point of Interest) to a Game Map. This allows you to give the P.O.I. a different name on the Region Map than the actual Game Map name. 
<br/>Not using this Setting will make the P.O.I. reveal together with the location on the Region Map.
