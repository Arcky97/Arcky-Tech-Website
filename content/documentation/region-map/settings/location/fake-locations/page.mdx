<Header title="Fake Locations">
  Manipulate the Map Position of certain Game Maps.
</Header>

## Function of the Setting 

The **Fake Locations Settings Section** includes a single Setting. It allows you to set, in combination with a Game Variable, a different Map Position than it would be defined in the Map_Metadata.txt PBS file. If there's no match found, the default value from the PBS file will be used.

```ruby
FakeRegionLocations = {
  14 => {
    98 => {
      1 => [1, 1, 1],
      2 => [0, 2, 2]
    },
    99 => {
      2 => [1, 5, 5]
    }
  },
  70 => {
    98 => {
      3 => [1, 3, 3]
    },
    99 => {
      1 => [0, 4, 4]
    }
  }
}
```
