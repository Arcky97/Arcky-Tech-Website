## ProgressSwitches

This Setting allows you to assign a Game Switch to each district you defined in [RegionDistricts](#region-districts). The only requirement for this setting is that the [Progress Counter](../progress-counter) is enabled.

```ruby
ProgressSwitches = {
  "Essen" => 106,
  "North Essen" => 99,
  "East Essen" => 100,
  "South Essen" => 101,
  "West Essen" => 102,
  "Central Essen" => 103,
  "Central Tiall" => 104
}
```

### Possible Values

Each Item here must match with a [district name](#regiondistricts) followed by `=>` and a `Game Switch ID`.
Once a district is 100% in progress, the assigned Game Switch will be set to `ON` so you can give an eventual in game reward.
