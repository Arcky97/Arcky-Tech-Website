```ruby
CountItemsToMainMap = {
  2 => [3, 4, 8],
  3 => [2, 4, 8],
  4 => [2, 3, 8],
  8 => [2, 3, 4]
}
```

### Possible Values

Each Item exist out of the `Game ID` of the Main Map followed by an array of the `Game IDs` of the Game Maps with the same Map Position. 

<Callout type="hint">
  There's no additional validation so if you link Game Maps with a different Map Position, it'll work just fine
