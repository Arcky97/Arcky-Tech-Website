## ShowExtendedButton

Use this Setting to set which button needs to be pressed to show the Extended Location Preview for a location on the Region Map. Opening the Extended Location Preview is only possible when the Location Preview for a Location is already open.

<SetVer
  v201="SHOW_EXTENDED_BUTTON = Input::USE"
  v211="ShowExtendedButton = Input::USE"
/>

### Possible Values

- `Input::USE` = The Game Button

<Callout type="hint">
  This time you can set this to the same button as for [ShowLocationButton](location#showlocationbutton) since it's a follow up feature on the Location Preview.
