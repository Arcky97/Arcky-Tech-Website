## TrainerRematchesConfig

Use this Setting to define your Trainer Rematches to show in the Trainer Mode on the Region Map when a Rematch is available for one or more Trainers.

```ruby
TrainerRematchesConfig = {
  59 => [
    {
      name: "Crissy",
      type: "LASS",
      event: 10,
      map: 31
    },
    {
      name: "Bridget",
      type: "BEAUTY",
      event: 7,
      map: 31
    },
    {
      name: "Ford",
      type: "HIKER",
      event: 8,
      map: 31
    },
    {
      name: "Andrew",
      type: "FISHERMAN",
      event: 9,
      map: 31
    }
  ],
  "B" => {
    name: "Liam",
    type: "CAMPER",
    event: 4,
    map: 10
  },
}
```

### Possible Values

The Setup won't be explained in detail here, for that check [Trainer Preview](../../basic-setup/trainer-preview). 
<br/>There are 3 ways to define and register your rematches so the Trainer Mode can detect them.
- Using the Phone Registration System (setup for that is explained on the Essentials Wiki)
- Using a Game Switch followed by an array of items each containing the following:
  - `name: "Crissy` = The name of the Trainer.
  - `type: "LASS` = The class of the Trainer.
  - `event: 10` = The Game Event ID of the Trainer.
  - `map: 31` = The Game Map ID the Trainer event is on.
- Using the Self Switch of the Event itself.
