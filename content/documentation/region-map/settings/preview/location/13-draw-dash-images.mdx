## DrawDashImages

Use this Setting to whether or not draw a dash line below the Location Preview Description. This is meant as a separator line between the Description and Location Text.

```ruby 
DrawDashImages = true
```

### Possible Values

- `true` = A Dash line **<Gn>will be drawn</Gn>**.
- `false` = A Dash line **<Rd>will not be drawn</Rd>**

<Callout type="hint">
  If the [DirectionHeightSpacing](#directionheightspacing) is lower than the Dash Graphic height, the Dash will not be drawn to prevent covering Text elements.
