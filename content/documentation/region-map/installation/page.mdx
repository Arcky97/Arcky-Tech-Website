## First Time Installation 
<Callout type="warning">
  This page is meant for guiding you through installing this plugin for the first time. In case you want to update the plugin instead, please refer to the [Updating](updating) page instead.
</Callout>
The installation process for this plugin is mostly the same for v20.1 and v21.1. But there are a few differences in where to put the Graphics files and your custom Graphics.
<br/>
If you have any custom Graphics made related to the Pokedex UI, please make a backup of those Graphics as this plugin comes with modified Graphics for the Pokedex Area UI. These are required in order to actually see the Region Map on the Pokedex Area Page.
<br/>
## Common Installation Process 
1. Extract the Zip file using any extractor tool.
2. Inside the Arcky's Region Map folder,  you'll find 2 folders and 2 files <ImageWithCaption src="/images/documentation/region-map/Installation 1.png" caption="Plugin's Download Folder's Content" align="left" size="large"/>
3. The downloaded folder contains a new copy of townmapgen which now will support bigger Region Map Images and accepts an extra parameter. 
<br/> Copy the townmapgen.html file, which has the essentials version in it's name that you're using, into your game's root folder and remove the original one. <ImageWithCaption src="/images/documentation/region-map/Installation 2.png" caption="Adding the townmapgen.html to your game's folder" align="left" size="large"/>
