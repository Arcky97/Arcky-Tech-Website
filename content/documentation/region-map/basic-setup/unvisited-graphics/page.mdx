How to setup the Unvisited Graphics

---
</header>
Just like the Highlight Graphics, they are based on the HGSS style. So if you are using a different style for your Region Map, you'll have to retain the size this time as they are now (for example 48x48 for a 1 tile location) since there's no "Routes" folder this time.
<br/>
Inside the "Unvisited" folder you'll see these Graphics:
<ImageWithCaption src="/images/documentation/region-map/Unvisited Graphics.png" caption="Unvisited folder content" align="left" size="large"/>
You'll find this folder in:
- Graphics > Pictures > RegionMap > Highlights (v20.1)
- Graphics > UI > Town Map > Highlights (v21.1)
<br/>
The naming for these Graphics are exactly the same as those in the "Others" folder of the Highlight Graphics. But here it's only meant for locations that have a Fly Spot defined in the town_map.txt PBS file.
