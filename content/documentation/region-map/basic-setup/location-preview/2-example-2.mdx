## Example 2

```ruby
LappetTown = {
  description: "A fairly old and loud town. \nIt's a big and not so pretty place.",
  south: [13, 13],
  north: [13, 11],
  west: [12, 12],
  icon: "LappetTown" 
}
```
The only difference with Example 1 is in the `description:` parameter. As you might have noticed, before the second sentence, there's an `\n` (new line) command. This will put this second sentence on a new line.
