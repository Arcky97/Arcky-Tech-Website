## Overview

The following guide and examples are applyable for both v20.1 and v21.1.
<br/>
If some parts of examples are confusing to you, try this feature in a new project first and mess around with the settings to see what changes. You can also just ask me either on the Plugin's Discussion page or contact me on Discord.

Let's start with a list of all possible parameters the data for each location may contain:
<br/>
- `description:` (required) a short description of the location
- `icon:` (optional) a MiniMap of the location.
- directions (optional) allow you to add to which other locations you can go from this location. They may either be coordinates (like you define a point in the PBS) or text with the name of the location (if you want a different name than from the PBS). Possible directions are:
  - `north:`
  - `northEast:`
  - `east:`
  - `southEast:`
  - `south:`
  - `southWest:`
  - `west:`
  - `northWest:`
<br/>
The parameters will become more clear along with the examples below.

In the `000_Settings_and_Setup` folder of this plugin's folder (Arcky's Region Map), you'll find a file called `001_RegionMap_LocationInfo.rb`. Open this file with notepad++ or any code editor program.
<br/>
([Check this page](../settings) on how to edit the `000_RegionMap_Settings.rb` file.)
<br/>
This feature is also associated with a lot of Settings which are explained on this page.
