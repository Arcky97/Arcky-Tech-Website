## Example 2

In the second example, 1 or more Trainer Rematches are registered by using a Game Switch.
<Callout type="attention">
  When using this method, once the Switch is `ON`, **all the Trainers asigned** to this Switch **will be shown at once** on the Region Map. 
  <br/>**<Rd>It's up to you to have extra checks to know when all Trainers have been defeated. The Plugin is not going to handle that for you.</Rd>**
  <br/>The **Trainer Icons will be shown** on the Trainer Mode as long as the **asigned Switch is `ON`**.
</Callout>

```ruby
TrainerRematchesConfig = {
  59 => [
    {
      name: "Crissy",
      type: "LASS",
      event: 10,
      map: 31
    },
    {
      name: "Bridget",
      type: "BEAUTY",
