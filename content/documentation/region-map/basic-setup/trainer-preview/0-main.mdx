## Overview

The Trainer Rematch Preview does require a little setup but only if you decide to do it the way without using the phone registration system. I'm not going to explain how to register a Trainer for rematches in your Game because it's [explained on the wiki](https://essentialsdocs.fandom.com/wiki/Phone).
<br/>
Each Trainer you register in this Setting should have the following parameters:
- `name:` = The Trainer name.
- `type:` = The Trainer Class.
- `event` = The event ID of the Trainer.
- `map` = The Game Map ID of the Trainer event.
<br/>
For a Trainer to be shown on the Region Map, you'll need the Icon for that Trainer Class. Name the Graphic "mapTrainer" + `TrainerClass`, e.g., "mapTrainerFISHERMAN". The new update comes with all default Trainer Class Icons, you might want to add your own.
