The Extended Location Preview doesn't require any additional set-up but it will not work if

Below you'll find a short list of the possible Information this Feature can provide you.
<br/>
This Feature has various settings for you to modify and are all explained in [Extended Preview Settins](../settings/preview/extended-preview-settings) page.
<Callout type="hint">One thing you should keep in mind is that the Map Names are used from the map_metadata.txt PBS file for the Locations. You can use the LinkPoiToMap Setting to change the Name of your Maps. This will only apply for visual purpose in the Extended Preview and won't affect anything else outside the Region Map.</Callout>
<br/>
When Extended Preview is enabled and a Location Preview is shown on the Region Map, you'll be able to open the Extended Preview for this Location.
<br/>
Like usual, the Button Preview will tell you which button to press.
