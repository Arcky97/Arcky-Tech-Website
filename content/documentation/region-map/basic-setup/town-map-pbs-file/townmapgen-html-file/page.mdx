  How to edit the Town_Map.txt PBS file using the townmapgen.html tool.
</Header>

The advantage of this tool is that you can't run into the problem of having to many or too less `,`. The Tool adds the amount you need for you.

I added an extra Input Field "Image Name". 
<br/>This is where you should put the Graphic name for each point. 
<br/>Just like you would do manually while editing the PBS file.
<br/>This tool has also been edited so it supports bigger Graphic Region Map sizes.
<br/>There isn't much else to explain about this tool as it should be easy to use.
