Let's take a look at how the Town_Map.txt PBS file currently looks like (basic Essentials Version):
<br/>
```
[0]
Filename = mapRegion0.png
Name = Essen
Point = 13,12,Lappet Town,Oak's Lab,2,8,8
Point = 13,11,Route 1,Kurt's House
Point = 13,10,Cedolan City,Dept. Store,7,47,11
Point = 14,10,Cedolan City,,7,47,11
Point = 14,9,Route 2
Point = 14,8,Route 2
Point = 15,8,Lerucean Town,,23,11,15
Point = 16,8,Natural Park
Point = 15,7,Route 3

Point = 14,6,Route 3
Point = 13,6,Ingido Plateau,,35,17,7

Point = 13,13,Route 8,Diving area

```

What we need to do is add a new parameter at the end of each Point which will tell the Script which Graphic to use for the Highlight and Unvisited Graphics.
<br/>
We can do this by:
- [Editing the PBS file manually](town-map-pbs-file/manual-editing)
- [Using the townmapgen.html file](town-map-pbs-file/townmapgen-html-file)
