## v1.1.0: Town Map Editor 

### New Page
- You can town edit the town_map.txt pbs files through the editor instead of using the townmapgen.html tool. In case you're using my Region Map Plugin, make sure to enable that in the settings of the editor so it'll use the correct Graphic in `Graphics/UI/Town Map/Regions` instead of `Graphics/UI/Town Map`. If you're using using v20.1 of essentials, it should be able to auto detect that and look for the graphic in `Graphics/Pictures` by default or `Graphics/Pictures/RegionMap/Regions` if you're using Arcky's Region Map.

### Improvements
- Moved plugin settings to their own section in the Settings, this should make it easier to find and manage which ones you have installed.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed a typo in the Pokémon Settings Section for Colors.
- Fixed a crash with the EV's on the Trainers Editor Page.
