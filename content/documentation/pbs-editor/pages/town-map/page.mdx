## Overview

The Town Map page covers the Town Map PBS files. It is my own take on the townmapgen.html tool coming with essentials itself but with some new features and improvements. 
<br/>Below an overview of each Parameter. For more information of a field, you should check: [Region Map](hhttps://essentialsengine.miraheze.org/wiki/Region_map) on the wiki.
