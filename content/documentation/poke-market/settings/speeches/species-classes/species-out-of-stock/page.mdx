  How to use and define SpeciesOutOfStock speeches.
</Header>

The `SpeciesOutOfStock` determines what the NPC says when the player selects a Species that they have bought from this seller before. 
<br/>
All Species are limited to 1 for all time for each Seller. (I don't see a reason why the player would want to buy more than 1 of a same Species).

<SPSpeeches speech="SpeciesOutOfStock"/>

To define the `SpeciesOutOfStock`, use this structure:
<br/>
```ruby 
SpeciesOutOfStock: [
  "I don't have {1} anymore, you already bought it...", 
  "You want another {1}? Well aren't you satisfied with 1 already?"
]
```
### Placeholder Reference
