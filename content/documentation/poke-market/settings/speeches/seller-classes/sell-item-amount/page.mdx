</header>

The SellItemAmount is what the NPC will say when choosing how many of an Item you want to Sell.
<br/>
It is possible to include more than 1 speech if you want to but you can't add a Time or Day.
<br/>
Defining `SellItemAmount` looks like this:
<br/>
```ruby
SellItemAmount: [
  "How many {1} would you like to sell?"
]
```
- \{1\} = chosen Item's name (plural) (for ex. "Pok√© Balls").
