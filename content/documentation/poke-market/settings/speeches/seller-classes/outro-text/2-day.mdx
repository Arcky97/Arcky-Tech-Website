## OutroText + Day

It's possible to define an `OutroText` that changes depending on the **current day** in the game. Just like the default `OutroText`, you can include mutliple lines for variation, adn the script will randomly select one.
<br/>
Supported keys include:
<br/>
- `OutroTextMonday`
- `OutroTextTuesday`
- `OutroTextWednesday`
- `OutroTextThursday`
- `OutroTextFriday`
- `OutroTextSaturday`
- `OutroTextSunday`
<br/>
- `OutroTextWeek` applies to Money through Friday.
- `OutroTextWeekend` applies to Saturday and Sunday.

<br/>
Defining `OutroTextWeek` looks like this:

```ruby
OutroTextWeek: [
  "Thank you, come back tomorrow when we have new items."
]
```

Similarly, you can define speech for specific days. Here's an example for Friday:

```ruby
OutroTextFriday: [
  "Thank you and Happy Weekend to you as well."
]
```
This will be used by the script when the in-game day is Friday:
