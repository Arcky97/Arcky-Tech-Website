## OutroText + Day

It is possible to define an OutroText depending on the current Day in the game (just like with the [IntroText + Day](intro-text))
<br/>
- OutroTextMonday
- OutroTextTuesday
- OutroTextWednesday
- OutroTextThursday
- OutroTextFriday
- OutroTextSaturday
- OutroTextSunday
- OutroTextWeek
- OutroTextWeekend
<br/>
Week can be used as a combination for Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.
<br/>
Weekend can be used as a combination for Saturday and Sunday.
<br/>
Defining `OutroTextWeek` looks like this:
<br/>
```ruby
OutroTextWeek: [
  "Thank you, come back tomorrow when we have new items."
]
```

We can do the similar for Friday, defining `OutroTextFriday` looks like this:
<br/>
```ruby
OutroTextFriday: [
  "Thank you and Happy Weekend to you as well."
]
```
This will be used by the script when it's Friday in the game:
