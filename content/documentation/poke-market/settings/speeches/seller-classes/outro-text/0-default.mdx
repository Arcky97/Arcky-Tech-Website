## OutroText
<br/>
The OutroText is what the NPC will say when exiting the Mart Event, it's the last thing the NPC will say.
<br/>
It is possible to include more than 1 speech if you want to and you can add a Time and Day variant here.
<br/>
Defining `OutroText` looks like this:
<br/>
```ruby
OutroText: [
  "Do come again!", 
  "Thank you, I hope to see you again.", 
  "Thank you for your purchase, come again!"
]
```
