## OutroText

The `OutroText` determines what the NPC says when the player has chosen the **Exit** option.
<br/>
As shown in the example below, you can include multiple variations. The script will randomy choose one line from the array each time the player exits the Mart event.
<br/>
To define the `OutroText`, use this structure:
<br/>
```ruby
OutroText: [
  "Do come again!", 
  "Thank you, I hope to see you again.", 
  "Thank you for your purchase, come again!"
]
```
