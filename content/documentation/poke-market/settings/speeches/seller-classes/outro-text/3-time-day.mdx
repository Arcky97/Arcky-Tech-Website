## OutroText + Time + Day

We've already covered how to define `OutroText` by **Time** and by **Day** — but what if you want to combine both?
<br/>
Yes, it might sound a little wild — and it kind of is — but this feature gives you complete control. You can make the NPC salut the player differently on a **Wednesday Afternoon** then on a **Thursday Morning**, or anything in between.
<br/>
Just like with `OutroText + Day`, you can use broader categories like `Week` and `Weekend`, and just like the default `OutroText`, you can define multiple lines for variation.

Here's an example: 

```ruby
OutroTextDayWeekend: [
  "Thank you for your visit, enjoy your weekend."
]
```
This text is used when the current **Time** is within `Day` (5:00 AM to 7:59 PM) and the **Day** is Saturday or Sunday.

Another example:

```ruby
OutroTextDaySaturday: [
  "Thank you for your purchase. \nEnjoy the rest of your Saturday."
]
```
This text is used when the current **Time** is within `Day` (5:00 AM to 7:59 PM) and the **Day** is Saturday.

<Callout type="hint">
  You're not expected to define every possible combination. Just include what matter most to you — the script handles the fallbacks intelligently.
