## OutroText + Time

It is possible to define an OutroText depending on the current Time in the game (just like with [IntroText + Time](intro-text)). You can include more than 1 speech if you want to.
<br/>
These are the possibilities:
- `IntroTextMorning` - Used from 5 to 10 (5am to 10am)
- `IntroTextNoon` - Used from 10 to 2 (10pm to 2am)
- `IntroTextAfternoon` - Used from 14 to 17 (2pm to 5pm)
- `IntroTextEvening` - Used from 17 to 20 (5pm to 8pm)
- `IntroTextDay` - Used from 5 to 20 (5am to 8pm)
- `IntroTextNight` - Used from 20 to 5 (8pm to 5am)
<br/>
Defining `OutroTextEvening` looks like this:
<br/>
```ruby
OutroTextEvening: [
  "Have a nice Night, do come back again", 
  "Thank you for your purchase, enjoy your evening."
]
```
This will be used by the script when it's Evening in the game:
