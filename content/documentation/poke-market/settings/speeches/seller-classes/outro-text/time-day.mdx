## OutroText + Time + Day

It is possible to define an OutroText depending on the current Time and Day in the game (just like with the [IntroText + Time + Day](intro-text))
<br/>
Defining `OutroTextDayWeekend` looks like this:
<br/>
```ruby
OutroTextDayWeekend: [
  "Thank you for your visit, enjoy your weekend."
]
```

We can do similar for Saturday, defining `OutroTextDaySaturday` looks like this:
<br/>
```ruby
OutroTextDaySaturday: [
  "Thank you for your purchase. \nEnjoy the rest of your Saturday."
]
```
