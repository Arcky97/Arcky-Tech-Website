## OutroText + Time

It's possible to define an `OutroText` based on the in-game **Time of Day**.
Like with the default `OutroText`, you can provide multiple lines for variety, and the script will randomly select one each time.
<br/>
Here are the available time-based keys:
- `OutroTextMorning`— Used from 5:00 to 9:59 AM 
- `OutroTextNoon` — Used from 10:00 AM to 1:59 PM
- `OutroTextAfternoon` — Used from 2:00 to 4:59 PM 
- `OutroTextEvening` — Used from 5:00 to 7:59 PM
- `OutroTextDay` — Used from 5:00 AM to 7:59 PM (general fallback for daytime)
- `OutroTextNight` — Used from 8:00 PM to 4:59 AM 
<br/>
Note: `OutroTextDay` overlaps with Morning, Noon, Afternoon, and Evening. It acts as a fallback if no specific period is defined.
<br/>
Here's how you can defined `OutroTextEvening`:

```ruby
OutroTextEvening: [
  "Have a nice Night, do come back again", 
  "Thank you for your purchase, enjoy your evening."
]
```
This will be used by the script when the in-game time is between 5:00 and 7:59 PM:
