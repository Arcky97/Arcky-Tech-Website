  How to use and define SellItem speeches.

</header>

The SellItem is what the NPC will say when confirming the amount of an Item you want to Sell.
<br/>
It is possible to include more than 1 speech if you want to but you can't add a Time or Day.
<br/>
Defining `SellItem` looks like this:
<br/>
```ruby
SellItem: [
  "I can pay {1}.\nWould that be OK?"
]
```
- \{1\} = total sell price for the amount of the chosen Item (for ex. $100).
