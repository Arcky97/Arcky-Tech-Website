## IntroText + Time
<br/>
It is possible to define an IntroText depending on the current Time in the game and similar to the Default IntroText, you can include more than 1 speech if you want to.
<br/>
These are the possibilities:
- `IntroTextMorning` - Used from 5 to 10 (5am to 10am)
- `IntroTextNoon` - Used from 10 to 2 (10pm to 2am)
- `IntroTextAfternoon` - Used from 14 to 17 (2pm to 5pm)
- `IntroTextEvening` - Used from 17 to 20 (5pm to 8pm)
- `IntroTextDay` - Used from 5 to 20 (5am to 8pm)
- `IntroTextNight` - Used from 20 to 5 (8pm to 5am)
<br/>
It might be a bit confusing but Day is overlapped by Morning, Noon, Afternoon and Evening. Later on I'll explain more about this so you'll understand better.
<br/>
Defining IntroTextAfternoon looks like this:
<br/>
```ruby
IntroTextAfternoon: [
  "Good Afternoon, what can I do for you?"
]
```

This will be used by the script when it's Afternoon in the game:
<ImageWithCaption src="/images/documentation/poke-market/IntroTextAfternoon.png" caption="IntroTextAfternoon" align="center"/>
The script first checks what time it is in game.
<br/>
Then it checks if it's either matches with Morning, Day, Noon, Afternoon, Evening or Night.
<br/>
If the time would be 15 (3pm) it would assume it's Afternoon.
<br/>
But when you didn't provide an `IntroTextAfternoon`, it'll fall-back to `IntroTextDay`.
<br/>
If you also haven't defined one for Day, it'll use the default `IntroText` (this one should never be empty)
<br/>
Here's a simple break down of what I just mentioned above:
- Morning - If not then Day - if not then Default.
- Noon - If not then Day - If not then Default.
- Afternoon - If not then Day - If not then Default.
- Evening - If not then Day - If not then Default.
- Day - If not then Default.
- Night - If not then Default.
