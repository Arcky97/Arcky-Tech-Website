## IntroText + Time + Day

We've already covered how to define `IntroText` by **Time** and by **Day** — but what if you want to combine both?
<br/>
Yes, it might sound a little wild — and it kind of is — but this feature gives you complete control. You can make the NPC greet the player differently on a **Monday morning** then on a **Friday evening**, or anything in between.
<br/>
Just like with `IntroText + Day`, you can use broader categories like `Week` and `weekend`, and just like the default `IntroText`, you can define multiple lines for variation.

Here's an example:

```ruby
IntroTextDayWeek: [
  "Good Day, welcome to our store, what can I do for you?"
]
```
This text is used when the current **Time** is within `Day` (5:00 AM to 7:59 PM) and the **Day** is Monday through Friday.

Another example:

```ruby
IntroTextDayTuesday: [
  "Hello, what can I do for you on this fine Tuesday Noon?"
]
```
This text is used when the current **Time** is within `Day` (5:00 AM to 7:59 PM) and the **Day** is Tuesday.

### Fallback Behavior

Let's say the current in-game time is **Wednesday Morning**. The script will try to match in the following order:
1. `IntroTextMorningWednesday`
2. `IntrotextDayWednesday`
3. `IntroTextWednesday`
4. `IntroTextMorningWeek`
5. `IntroTextDayWeek`
6. `IntroTextWeek`
7. `IntroTextMorning`
8. `IntroTextDay`
9. `IntroText`

<Callout type="hint">
  You're not expected to define every possible combination. Just include what matters most to you — the script handles the fallbacks intelligently.
