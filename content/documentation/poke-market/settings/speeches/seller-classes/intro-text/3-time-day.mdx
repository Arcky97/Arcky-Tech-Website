## IntroText + Time + Day
<br/>
We have had an IntroText + Time and IntroText + Day. How about we combine both?
<br/>
This might sound a bit crazy, and it actually is, but you can go as far as you want in this one.
<br/>
Just like with IntroText + Day, you can use Week or Weekend and similar to the Default IntroText, you c an include more than 1 speech if you want to.
<br/>
Defining IntroTextDayWeek looks like this:
<br/>
```ruby
IntroTextDayWeek: [
  "Good Day, welcome to our store, what can I do for you?"
]
```

This will be used by the script when it's Day and it's either Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday in the game:

Or you can go more specific by using the exact day.
<br/>
Defining IntroTextDayTuesday would look like this:
<br/>
```ruby
IntroTextDayTuesday: [
  "Hello, what can I do for you on this fine Tuesday Noon?"
]
```

This will be used by the script when it's Day and it's Tuesday in the game:
<ImageWithCaption src="/images/documentation/poke-market/IntroTextDayTuesday.png" caption="IntroTextDayTuesday" align="center"/>
Let's list up the complete break down for how it'll choose the speech available:
<br/>
Let's say it's Wednesday Morning:
<br/>
IntroTextMorningWednesday - IntroTextDayWednesday - IntroTextWednesday - IntroTextMorningWeek - IntroTextDayWeek - IntroTextWeek - IntroTextMorning - IntroTextDay - IntroText 
<br/>
Like I said before, you can go as far as you want yourself in this. It might get complicated for sure but you're not supposed to have a text for each possible IntroText by Time and Day.
