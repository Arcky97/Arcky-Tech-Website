## IntroText + Day

It is possible to define an IntroText depending on the current Day in the game and similar to the Default IntroText, you can include more than 1 speech if you want to.
<br/>
- `IntroTextMonday`
- `IntroTextTuesday`
- `IntroTextWednesday`
- `IntroTextThursday`
- `IntroTextFriday`
- `IntroTextSaturday`
- `IntroTextSunday`
- `IntroTextWeek`
- `IntroTextWeekend`
<br/>
Week can be used as a combination for Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.
<br/>
Weekend can be used as a combination for Saturday and Sunday.
<br/>
Defining `IntroTextWeekend` looks like this:
<br/>
```ruby
IntroTextWeekend: [
  "Hello, it's weekend so we'll be closing soon, what do you want?"
]
```

For example you can make the NPC sound rude in the weekend.
<br/>
This will be used by the script when it's either Saturday or Sunday in the game:

We can do the similar for Monday, defining `IntroTextMonday` looks like this:
<br/>
```ruby
IntroTextMonday: [
  "Happy Monday - no discounts though - what can I do for you?"
]
```

This will be used by the script when it's Monday in the game:
<ImageWithCaption src="/images/documentation/poke-market/IntroTextMonday.png" caption="IntroTextMonday" align="center"/>
The script first checks what day it is in game.
<br/>
But when you didn't provide an IntroText + Day (for example Monday), the fall-back will look like this:
<br/>
Here's a break down of what I mentioned above:
- Day of week - If not then week or weekend - If not then Time of Day (same as with IntroText + Time) and so on.
<br/>
Let's simplify this with an example, let' say it's Money and Evening:
IntroTextMoney - IntroTextWeek - IntroTextEvening - IntroTextDay - IntroText
<br/>
There are a few checks between the first and second one but I'll come to this in [IntroText + Time + Day](/documentation/poke-market/settings/speeches/seller-classes/intro-text#time-day).
