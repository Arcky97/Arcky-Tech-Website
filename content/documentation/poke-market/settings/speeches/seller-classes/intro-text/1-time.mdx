## IntroText + Time

It's possible to define an `IntroText` based on the in-game **Time of Day**. Like with the default `IntroText`, you can provide multiple lines for variety, and the script will randomly select one each time.
<br/>
Here are the available time-based keys:
- `IntroTextMorning` — Used from 5:00 to 9:59 AM
- `IntroTextNoon` — Used from 10:00 AM to 1:59 PM
- `IntroTextAfternoon` — Used from 2:00 PM to 4:59 PM
- `IntroTextEvening` — Used from 5:00 to 7:59 PM
- `IntroTextDay` — Used from 5:00 AM to 7:59 PM (general fallback for daytime)
- `IntroTextNight` — Used from 8:00 PM to 4:59 AM
<br/>
Note: `IntroTextDay` overlaps with Morning, Noon, Afternoon, and Evening. It acts as a fallback if no specific period is defined.
<br/>
Here's how you can define `IntroTextAfternoon`:
<br/>
```ruby
IntroTextAfternoon: [
  "Good Afternoon, what can I do for you?"
]
```

This will be used by the script when the in-game time is between 2:00 and 4:59 PM:

### Fallback Behavior: 
1. The script first determines the current in-game hour.
2. Based on that, it checks for one of the specific keys:
    - Morning, Noon, Afternoon, Evening
3. If none of the specifc ones exist, it checks for:
    - `IntroTextDay` (if between 5 AM and 8 PM)
    - `IntroTextNight` (if between 8 PM and 5 AM)
4. If none of those are found, it finally falls back to:
    - The default `IntroText`
<br/>
### Simplified Breakdown
- If 3 PM: => `IntroTextAfternoon` => `IntroTextDay` => `IntroText`
- If 11 AM: => `IntroTextNoon` => `IntroTextDay` => `IntroText`
- If 6 AM: => `IntroTextMorning` => `IntroTextDay` => `IntroText`
- If 9 PM: => `IntroTextNight` => `IntroText`
<br/>
No matter the time or fallback path, **you should always define a default** `IntroText`, since it is the ultimate fallback and ensures there's always a valid message.
