## IntroText + Day

It's possible to define an `IntroText` that changes depending on the **current day** in the game. Just like the default `IntroText`, you can include multiple lines for variation, and the script will randomly select one.
<br/>
Supported keys include:
<br/>
- `IntroTextMonday`
- `IntroTextTuesday`
- `IntroTextWednesday`
- `IntroTextThursday`
- `IntroTextFriday`
- `IntroTextSaturday`
- `IntroTextSunday`
<br/>
- `IntroTextWeek` applies to Money through Friday.
- `IntroTextWeekend` applies to Saturday and Sunday.

<br/>
Defining `IntroTextWeekend` looks like this:

```ruby
IntroTextWeekend: [
  "Hello, it's weekend so we'll be closing soon, what do you want?"
]
```

This makes it possible, for example, to make the NPC behave differently — perhaps ruder — on the weekend.

Similarly, you can define speech for specific days. Here's an example for Monday:

```ruby
IntroTextMonday: [
  "Happy Monday - no discounts though - what can I do for you?"
]
```
This will be used by the script when the in-game day in Monday:

### Fallback Behavior
The script checks the following order when deciding which `IntroText` to use:
1. A day-specific key (e.g., `IntroTextMonday`)
2. `IntroTextWeek or IntroTextWeekend` depending on the day
3. Time-based alternative (like `IntroTextEvening`)
4. `IntroTextDay`
5. The default `IntroText`
<br/>
For example if it's **Monday Evening**, the script will check:
<br/>`IntroTextMonday` => `IntroTextWeek` => `IntroTextEvening` => `IntroTextDay` => `IntroText`
<br/>
There are additional checks between these steps, which are covered in more detail in the [IntroText + Time + Day](/documentation/poke-market/settings/speeches/seller-classes/intro-text#3-time-day) section.
