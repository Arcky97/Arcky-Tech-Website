## IntroText

The `IntroText` determines what the NPC says when your first talk to them (i.e., at the start of the interaction).
<br/>
As shown in the example below, you can include multiple variations. The script will randomly choose one line from the array each time the player interacts with the NPC.
<br/>
To define the `IntroText`, use this structure:
<br/>
```ruby
IntroText: [
  "Good Day, welcome, how may I serve you?", 
  "Hello, welcome, what can I mean for you?", 
  "Hello, Welcome what can I get for you?"
]
```
