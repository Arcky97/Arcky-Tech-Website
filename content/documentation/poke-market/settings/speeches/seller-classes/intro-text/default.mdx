## IntroText
<br/>
The IntroText is what the NPC will say when talking to it (at the start of interaction). 
<br/>
As you can see from the array below, there are 3 different Strings added. The script will choose a random one out of these 3 (any amount of speeches you added) each time you talk to the npc again.
<br/>
Defining IntroText looks like this:
<br/>
```ruby
IntroText: [
  "Good Day, welcome, how may I serve you?", 
  "Hello, welcome, what can I mean for you?", 
  "Hello, Welcome what can I get for you?"
]
```
