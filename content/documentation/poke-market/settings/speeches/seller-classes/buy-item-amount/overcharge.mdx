## BuyItemAmountOvercharge

The BuyItemAmountOvercharge is what the NPC will say when choosing how many of an item you want to buy. But only when there's a Discount (Overcharge) Variable added to the store and the Overcharge is higher than 0%.
<br/>
It is possible to include more than 1 speech if you want to but you can't add a Time and Day.
<br/>
Defining `BuyItemAmountOvercharge` looks like this:
<br/>
```ruby
BuyItemAmountOvercharge: [
  "There's overcharge on {1}, you must pay ${2} instead of ${3}. So how many?"
]
```
- \{1\} = contains the Item's plural name (for ex. "Pok√© Balls")

- \{2\} = the Item's price with overcharge. (for ex. "$220")

- \{3\} = the item's original price (for ex. "$200")

<Callout type="hint">You don't need to use all \{1\}, \{2\} and \{3\}. If you use \{1\} and \{2\} and not \{3\} it will work just fine.</Callout>
