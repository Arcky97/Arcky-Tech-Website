## BuyItemAmountOvercharge

The `BuyItemAmountOvercharge` determines what the NPC says when the player is prompted to choose how many of an item they want to buy **and an Overcharge has been applied to the Mart event**.
<br/>
Just like with `IntroText`, you can define multiple entries, and the script will randomly choose one each time.
<Callout type="attention">
  Unlike `IntroText`, `BuyItemAmountOvercharge` **<Rd>does not support</Rd>** Time and Day variants — this is intentionally kept simpler.
</Callout>
Defining `BuyItemAmountOvercharge` looks like this:
<br/>
```ruby
BuyItemAmountOvercharge: [
  "There's overcharge on {1}, you must pay ${2} instead of ${3}. So how many?"
]
```

### Placeholder Reference
- `{1}` = chosen item's name (plural) — e.g., `"Poké Balls"`
- `{2}` = Overcharge price — e.g., `"$220"`
- `{3}` = Original price — e.g., `"$200"` (optional)
