## BuyItemAmount

The BuyItemAmount is what the NPC will say when choosing how many of an Item you want to buy.
<br/>
It is possible to include more than 1 speech if you want to but you can't add a Time or Day.
<br/>
Defining `BuyItemAmount` looks like this:
<br/>
```ruby
BuyItemAmount: [
  "So how many {1}?", 
  "How many {1} would you like?"
]
```
- \{1\} = chosen item's name (plural) (for ex. "Pok√© Balls)
