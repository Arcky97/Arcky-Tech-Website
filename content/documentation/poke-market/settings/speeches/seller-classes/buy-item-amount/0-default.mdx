## BuyItemAmount

The `BuyItemAmount` determines what the NPC says when the player is prompted to choose how many of an item they want to buy. 
<br/>
Just like with `IntroText`, you can define multiple entries, and the script will randomy choose one each time.
<Callout type="attention">
  Unlike `IntroText`, `BuyItemAmount` **<Rd>does not support</Rd>** Time or Day variations — this is intentionally kept simpler.
</Callout>
To define the `CategoryText`, use this structure:
<br/>
```ruby
BuyItemAmount: [
  "So how many {1}?", 
  "How many {1} would you like?"
]
```
### Placeholder Reference
- `{1}` = Chosen item's name (plural) — e.g., `"Poké Balls"`
