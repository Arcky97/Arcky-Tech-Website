## BuyItemAmountDiscount

The BuyItemAmountDiscount is what the NPC will say when choosing how many of an Item you want to buy. But only when there's a discount variable added to the store and the Discount is higher than 0%.
<br/>
It is possible to include more than 1 speech if you want to but you can't add a Time or Day.
<br/>
Defining `BuyItemAmountDiscount` looks like this:
<br/>
```ruby
BuyItemAmountDiscount: [
  "There's a discount on {1}, they're {2} instead of {3}. How many would you like?"
]
```
- \{1\} = contains the Item's plural name (for ex. "Pok√© Balls")

- \{2\} = the Item's price with discount. (for ex. "$180")

- \{3\} = the item's original price (for ex. "$200")
