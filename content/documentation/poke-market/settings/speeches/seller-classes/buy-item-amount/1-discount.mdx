## BuyItemAmountDiscount

The `BuyItemAmountDiscount` determines what the NPC says when the player is prompted to choose how many of an item they want to buy **and a Discount has been applied to the Mart event**.
<br/>
Just like with `IntroText`, you can define multiple entries, and the script will randomly choose one each time.
<Callout type="attention">
  Unlike `IntroText`, `BuyItemAmountDiscount` **<Rd>does not support</Rd>** Time and Day variants — this is intentionally kept simpler.
</Callout>
To define the `BuyItemAmountDiscount`, use this structure:
<br/>
```ruby
BuyItemAmountDiscount: [
  "There's a discount on {1}, they're {2} instead of {3}. How many would you like?"
]
```
### Placeholder Reference 
- `{1}` = chosen item's name (plural) — e.g., `"Poké Balls"`
- `{2}` = Discounted price — e.g., `"$180"`
- `{3}` = Original price — e.g., `"$200"` (optional)
