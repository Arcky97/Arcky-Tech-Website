</header>

The first message is the IntroText Speech you have set for this mart (if a specific Seller Class is specified). 
<br/>
Only an option to checkout is available which is modifyable in [MenuText](menu-text).
<br/>
Once you have paid the bill, the other options will be available again.

The BillCheckOut is what the NPC will say when selecting the option to pay the bill.
<br/>
It is possible to include more than 1 speech if you want to but you can't add a Time or Day.
<br/>
Defining `BillCheckOut` looks like this:
<br/>
```ruby
BillCheckOut: [
  "Your basket contains {1} which comes to a total of {2}, please."
]
```
- \{1\} = A list of items with their amount that were in the basket (for ex. 25 Potions and 12 Pok√© Balls).
- \{2\} = The Total price of all Items in the basket (for ex. $7400)

If any items from the bill have a Bonus Item defined, this will be the next message, the same speech as for BuyBonusMult is used here.
