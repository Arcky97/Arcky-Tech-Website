  How to use and define BillCheckOut speeches.
</Header>

The first message the player will be prompted with is the `IntroText`. 
<br/>
There'll be only 2 options to choose from, **Pay the Bill** and **Exit**.
<br/>
See [MenuText](menu-text) for more information.
<br/>
Once the Player has paid the Bill, the `MenuReturnText` is used and the player will be prompted with the options **Buy**, **Sell** (if allowed) and **Exit**.

The `BillCheckOut` determines what the NPC will say when the option to **Pay the Bill** was chosen.

To define the `BillCheckOut`, use this structure:

```ruby
BillCheckOut: [
  "Your basket contains {1} which comes to a total of {2}, please."
]
```
### Placeholder Reference
- `{1}` = The list of Items (including their amounts) that were added to the Basket — e.g., `"25 Potions and 12 Poké Balls"`
- `{2}` = The Total Price to pay — e.g., `"$7400"`

If any Items have a Bonus Item defined, this will be the next message the player will be prompted with (uses the `BuyBonusMult` Speech).
