## PurchaseCount

The PurchaseCount is what the NPC will say when you have purchased 1 amount of an Item from the [ItemPurchaseCounter](../../../settings/item-purchase-counter) setting.
<br/>
Remove this parameter in the Seller Class if you don't want to use it.
<br/>
It is possible to include more than 1 speech if you want to but you can't add a Time or Day.
<br/>
Defining `PurchaseCount` looks like this:
<br/>
```ruby
PurchaseCount: [
  "Congratulations, you've earned 1 loyalty point!"
]
```
