<Header title="Seller Classes">
  List of all Seller Class parameters.
</Header>

This setting is the most extensive one in the entire plugin. You can go as deep as you'd like customizing it — or choose not to use it at all.
<br/>
Adding a Seller Class to the event method is simple: after the list of items, just add the Seller Class using `speech: "ProSeller"`. Make sure the string matches the constant name defined for the class (explained below). Two example classes are included by default, including "ProSeller".

```ruby
def pbSomeMart
  pbPokemonMart([
    :POKEBALL, :GREATBALL, :ULTRABALL,
    :POTION, :SUPERPOTION, :HYPERPOTION, :MAXPOTION,
    :FULLRESTORE, :REVIVE,
    :ANTIDOTE, :PARALYZEHEAL, :AWAKENING, :BURNHEAL, :ICEHEAL,
    :FULLHEAL,
    :REPEL, :SUPERREPEL, :MAXREPEL
  ], speech: "ProSeller", useCat: true)
end
```
The Seller Class defined everything the seller says to the player. Normally, the seller repeats the same generic lines — but with this setup, you can make them sound much more dynamic and natural by adding variation based on the player's actions.

```ruby
ProSeller = {
  # Text when talking to them. This is the default one.
  IntroText: ["Good Day, welcome, how may I serve you?", "Hello, welcome, what can I mean for you?", "Hello, Welcome what can I get for you?"],
  # Text when choosing to buy item. (optional: If you make this empty( [] ), you'll go to the buy screen directly.)
  CategoryText: [], # or CategoryText: ["Which Category would you like to view?"],
  # Text when choosing amount of item. {1} = item name.
  BuyItemAmount: ["So how many {1}?"],
  # Text when choosing amount of item with discount. {1} = item name {2} = discount price {3} = original price.
  BuyItemAmountDiscount: ["There's a discount on {1}, they're ${2} instead of ${3}. How many would you like?"],
  # Text when choosing amount of item with overcharge. {1} = item name {2} = overcharge price {3} = original price.
  BuyItemAmountOvercharge: ["There's overcharge on {1}, you must pay ${2} instead of ${3}. So how many?"],
  # Text when buying 1 of an item. {1} = item vowel {2} = item name {3} = price.
  BuyItem: ["So you want {1} {2}?\nIt'll be ${3}. All right?", "So you would like to buy {1} {2}?\nThat's going to cost you ${3}!"],
  # Text when buying 2 or more of an item. {1} = amount {2} = item name (plural) {3} = price.
  BuyItemMult: ["So you want {1} {2}?\nThey'll be ${3}. All right?"],
  # Text when buying important item (that you can only buy 1 off). {1} = item name {2} = price.
  BuyItemImportant: ["So you want {1}?\nIt'll be ${2}. All right?"],
  # Text when wanted item is out of stock. {1} = item name (plural) {2} = time in days (tomorrow, in 2 days, in x days, in a week, next week etc.)
  BuyOutOfStock: ["We're really sorry, this item is currently out of stock. Come back {2}!", "We're sorry but we don't have any {1} left. Come back {2}!", "Come back {2} when we have more {1}."],
  # Text when bought item.
  BuyThanks: ["Here you are! Thank you!"],
  # Text when 10 of a kind of pokeballs are bought. {1} = item name.
  BuyBonus: ["And have 1 {1} on the house!"],
  # Text when 20 or more of a kind of pokeballs are bought. {1} = amount {2} = item name.
  BuyBonusMult: ["And have {1} {2} on the house!"],
  # Text when you don't have enough money to buy x item(s).
  NotEnoughMoney: ["You don't have enough money."],
  # Text when you don't have enough room in your bag. (Only used if you have an item limit).
  NoRoomInBag: ["You have no room in your Bag."],
  # Text when selecting an item to sell. {1} = item name
  SellItem: ["How many {1} would you like to sell?"],
  # Text when confirming amount of selected item to sell. {1} = price
  SellItemConfirm: ["I can pay ${1}.\nWould that be OK?"],
  # Text when unable to sell selected item. {1} = item name
  CantSellItem: ["Oh, no. I can't buy {1}."],
  # Text when returning to menu to choose either buying, selling or exit.
  MenuReturnText: ["Is there anything else I can do for you?", "What else could I mean for you today?"],
  # Text when the NPC is checking the items in the basket. {1} = list of each amount and item {2} = total price to pay.
  BillCheckOut: ["Your basket contains {1} which comes to a total of {2}, please."]
  # Text when exiting.
  OutroText: ["Do come again!", "Thank you, I hope to see you again.", "Thank you for your purchase, come again!"]
