## BuyItem

The `BuyItem` determines what the NPC says when the player has confirmed the chosen amount of the item (only 1) they want to buy.

<PMSpeeches speech="BuyItem" />

To define the `BuyItem`, use this structure:

```ruby
BuyItem: [
  "So you want {1} {2}?\nIt'll be ${3}. All right?", 
  "So you would like to buy {1} {2}?\nThat's going to cost you ${3}!"
]
```
### Placeholder Reference
- `{1}` = Chosen Item's amount (**always 1**) — e.g., `"1"`
- `{2}` = Chosen Item's name (singular) — e.g., `"Poké Ball"`
- `{3}` = Final Item price (after discount/overcharge if any) — e.g., `$200`
