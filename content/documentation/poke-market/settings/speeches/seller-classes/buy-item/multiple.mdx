## BuyItemMult

The BuyItemMult is what the NPC will say when you buy 2 or more of an Item.
<br/>
It is possible to include more than 1 speech if you want to but you can't add a Time or Day.
<br/>
Defining `BuyItemMult` looks like this:
<br/>
```ruby
BuyItemMult: [
  "So you want {1} {2}?\nThey'll be ${3}. All right?"
]
```
- \{1\} = chosen amount of an Item (for ex. 2)

- \{2\} = chosen Item's name (plural) (for ex. "Great Balls).

- \{3\} = total price of the amount of chosen Item (for ex. "$1200").
