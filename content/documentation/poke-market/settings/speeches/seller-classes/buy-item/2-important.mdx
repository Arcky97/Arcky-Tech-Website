## BuyItemImportant

The BuyItemImportant is what the NPC will say when you buy an item that is marked as Important (according to the [Essentials Wiki](https://essentialsengine.miraheze.org/wiki/Items), TMs, HMs and Key Items are marked as important Items by default).
<br/>
It is possible to include more than 1 speech if you want to but you can't add a Time or Day.
<br/>
Defining `BuyItemImportant` looks like this:
<br/>
```ruby
BuyItemImportant: [
  "So you want {1}?\nIt'll be ${2}. All right?"
]
```
- \{1\} = chosen Important Item's name (singular) (for ex. "Escape Rope").

- \{2\} = price of chosen Important Item (for ex. $500).

You can only buy 1 of the same Important Item and once you bought it, it'll no longer show in the Items.
