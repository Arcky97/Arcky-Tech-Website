## BuyItem

The (default) BuyItem is what the NPC will say when you buy only 1 of an item.
<br/>
It is possible to include more than 1 speech if you want to but you can't add a Time or Day.
<br/>
Defining `BuyItem` looks like this:
<br/>
```ruby
BuyItem: [
  "So you want {1} {2}?\nIt'll be ${3}. All right?", 
  "So you would like to buy {1} {2}?\nThat's going to cost you ${3}!"
]
```
- \{1\} = chosen amount (in this case 1) of the Item.

- \{2\} = chosen Item's name (singular) (for ex. "Pok√© Ball).

- \{3\} = price of the 1 chosen Item (for ex. "$200").
