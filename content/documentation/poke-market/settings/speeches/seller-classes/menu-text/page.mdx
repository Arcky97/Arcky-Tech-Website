  How to use and define MenuText speeches.
</Header>

The `MenuText` is used by a Mart event when presenting the player with different options â€” such as **Buy**, **Sell** (if allowed), **Exit**, or **Pay the Bill** (if you've added items to your basket from a Shelf event).
<br/>
These dialogues can be customized through the following speech parameters. If you don't define them in a Seller Class, the default values will be used.
