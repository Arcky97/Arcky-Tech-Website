## BuyBonus
The BuyBonus is what the NPC will say when buying 1 time the required amount for an item that has a BonusItem defined in [BonusItems](../../../settings/bonus-items) setting.
<br/> 
It is possible to include more than 1 speech if you want to but you can't add a Time and Day.
<br/>
Defining `BuyBonus` looks like this:
<br/>
```ruby
BuyBonus: ["And have 1 {1} on the house!"]
```
- \{1\} = Bonus Item's name (for ex. "Premier Ball")
