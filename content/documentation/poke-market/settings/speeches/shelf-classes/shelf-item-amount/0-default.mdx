## ShelfItemAmount

The ShelfItemAmount is what the shelf will say when selecting an item that you haven't added to your basket yet.
<br/>
It is possible to include more than 1 speech if you want to.
<br/>
Defining `ShelfItemAmount` looks like this:
<br/>
```ruby
ShelfAmountItem: [
  "How many {1} would you like to add to your basket?"
]
```
- \{1\} = chosen item's name (plural) (for ex. "Potions").
