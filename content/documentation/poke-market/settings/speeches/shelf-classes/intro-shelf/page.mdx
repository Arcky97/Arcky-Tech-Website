  How to use and define IntroShelf speeches.

  ---
</header>

The IntroShelf is what the Shelf will say (not that Shelfs speak) when talking to it.
<br/>
It is possible to include more than 1 speech if you want to but unlike with the Seller Class IntroText, you cannot add a Time and Day variant.
<br/>
Defining `IntroShelf` looks like this:
<br/>
```ruby
IntroShelf: [
  "Is there anything catching your eye?", 
  "How nice, you can buy items from the shelf now too! :P"
]
```
