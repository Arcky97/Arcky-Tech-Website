  How to use and define NotEnoughMoneyItem speeches.

</header>

The NotEnoughMoneyItem is what the shelf will say when selecting an item and you don't have enough money to add more of this item to your basket.
<br/>
Unlike [NotEnoughMoney](not-enough-money), this happens when you already have a certain amount added of this item.
<br/>
Pressing "Yes" will lead you to the [NotEnoughMoneyAmount](not-enough-money-amount) speech, pressing "No" will not do anything.
<br/>
It is possible to include more than 1 speech if you want to.
<br/>
Defining `NotEnoughMoneyItem` looks like this:
<br/>
```ruby
NotEnoughMoneyItem: [
  "You are out of {1}. Change the quantity of {2} you have in your basket?"
]
```
- \{1\} = the currency set for this shelf (for ex. "Money")

- \{2\} = chosen Item's name (plural) (for ex. "Potions").
