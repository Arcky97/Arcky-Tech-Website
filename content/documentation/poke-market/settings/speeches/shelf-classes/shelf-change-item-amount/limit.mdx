## ShelfLimitItemAmount

The ShelfLimitItemAmount is what the shelf will say when selecting an item that you have the max amount off in your basket (only when you're using a limit for that item).
<br/>
It is possible to include more than 1 speech if you want to.
<br/>
Defining `ShelfLimitItemAmount` looks like this:
<br/>
```ruby
ShelfLimitAmountItem: [
  "Your basket has all {1} in stock, change it to how many?"
]
```
- \{1\} = chosen Item's name (singular or plural) (for ex. Potions).
