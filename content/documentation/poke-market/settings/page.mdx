## Setup 

Since **v1.4.0**, the way you provide settings to a Mart or Shelf event has changed — and improved!
- You no longer need to worry about the *order* of arguments (except for the item list, which should **always come first**).
- Here's how you'd define a Mart event:
<br/>
```ruby
def pbSomeMart
  pbPokemonMart([
    :POKEBALL, :GREATBALL, :ULTRABALL,
    :ESCAPEROPE,
    :REPEL, :SUPERREPEL, :MAXREPEL,
    :GRASSMAIL, :FLAMEMAIL,
    :BUBBLEMAIL, :SPACEMAIL
  ])
end
```

Each optional argument is explained below and in more detail on its corresponding Settings page.

---
### speech: "string"
This lets you assign a specific <Ye>Seller Class</Ye> to the event.
<br/>
```ruby 
  speech: "ProSeller"
```
```ruby
def pbSomeMart
  pbPokemonMart([
    :POKEBALL, :GREATBALL, :ULTRABALL,
    :ESCAPEROPE,
    :REPEL, :SUPERREPEL, :MAXREPEL,
    :GRASSMAIL, :FLAMEMAIL,
    :BUBBLEMAIL, :SPACEMAIL
  ], speech: "ProSeller")
end
```
➡️See [Seller Class](/documentation/poke-market/settings/speeches/seller-classes) for more info.

---
### useCat: true / false
This enables or disables <Bl>Item Categories</Bl>.
<br/>
```ruby
  useCat: true
```
```ruby
def pbSomeMart
  pbPokemonMart([
    :POKEBALL, :GREATBALL, :ULTRABALL,
    :ESCAPEROPE,
    :REPEL, :SUPERREPEL, :MAXREPEL,
    :GRASSMAIL, :FLAMEMAIL,
    :BUBBLEMAIL, :SPACEMAIL
  ], speech: "ProSeller", useCat: true)
end
```

---
### Discount: number
Use this to apply a discount by refering a Game Variable ID:
<br/>
```ruby
  discount: 26
```
```ruby
def pbSomeMart
  pbPokemonMart([
    :POKEBALL, :GREATBALL, :ULTRABALL,
    :ESCAPEROPE,
    :REPEL, :SUPERREPEL, :MAXREPEL,
    :GRASSMAIL, :FLAMEMAIL,
    :BUBBLEMAIL, :SPACEMAIL
  ], speech: "ProSeller", useCat: true, discount: 26)
end
```

---
### currency: "string"
Sets which <Ye>currency</Ye> the Mart or Shelf should use.
Valid default values:
- `"money"` or `"gold"`
- `"coins"`
- `"bp"` or `"battle points"`
<br/>
```ruby 
  currency: "coins"
```
```ruby
def pbSomeMart
  pbPokemonMart([
    :POKEBALL, :GREATBALL, :ULTRABALL,
    :ESCAPEROPE,
    :REPEL, :SUPERREPEL, :MAXREPEL,
    :GRASSMAIL, :FLAMEMAIL,
    :BUBBLEMAIL, :SPACEMAIL
  ], speech: "ProSeller", useCat: true, discount: 26, currency: "coins")
end
```

---
### cantSell: true / false 
Disables the ability to sell items in this event.
This is *optional* and defaults to `false` (meaning selling is allowed).
<br/>
```ruby 
  cantSell: true
```
```ruby
def pbSomeMart
  pbPokemonMart([
    :POKEBALL, :GREATBALL, :ULTRABALL,
    :ESCAPEROPE,
    :REPEL, :SUPERREPEL, :MAXREPEL,
    :GRASSMAIL, :FLAMEMAIL,
    :BUBBLEMAIL, :SPACEMAIL
  ], speech: "ProSeller", useCat: true, discount: 26, currency: "money", cantSell: true)
end
```

---
### billEnd: true / false 
If enabled, the Mart event will end after paying the bill.
<br/>
```ruby
  billEnd: true
```
```ruby 
def pbSomeMart
  pbPokemonMart([
    :POKEBALL, :GREATBALL, :ULTRABALL,
    :ESCAPEROPE,
    :REPEL, :SUPERREPEL, :MAXREPEL,
    :GRASSMAIL, :FLAMEMAIL,
    :BUBBLEMAIL, :SPACEMAIL
  ], speech: "ProSeller", useCat: true, discount: 26, currency: "money", cantSell: true, billEnd: true)
end
```

--- 
### random: ["string", number]
Use this to select a specific or random amount of items from the given item list. 
- The first element is the refresh time for items to be repicked randomly. 
- The second element is the amount of items you want to be selected randomly.
<br/>
Allowed refresh times are the same as the Refresh Rate for Item Limits with exception for `"random"` not being supported.
<br/>
- select a fixed amount.
```ruby 
  random: ["daily", 4]
```
- select a random amount.
```ruby
  random: ["daily", rand(1..4)]
```
```ruby 
def pbSomeMart
  pbPokemonMart([
    :POKEBALL, :GREATBALL, :ULTRABALL,
    :ESCAPEROPE,
    :REPEL, :SUPERREPEL, :MAXREPEL,
    :GRASSMAIL, :FLAMEMAIL,
    :BUBBLEMAIL, :SPACEMAIL
  ], speech: "ProSeller", useCat: true, discount: 26, currency: "money", cantSell: true, billEnd: true, random: ["daily", rand(1..4)])
end
```
