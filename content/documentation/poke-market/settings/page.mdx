## Setup 
<br/>
Since v1.4.0 giving each setting you want to use for a Mart of Shelf Event has changed a bit and it should be a lot easier now as the order you give the settings don't even matter anymore. (Except for the item list which should **always come first**.)
<br/>
I'll explain the different possibilities of arguments you may give or not give to the mart event.
<br/>
Using the example from [Setting up a Mart Event](/documentation/poke-market/setup/mart-event).
<br/>
```ruby
def pbSomeMart
  pbPokemonMart([
    :POKEBALL, :GREATBALL, :ULTRABALL,
    :ESCAPEROPE,
    :REPEL, :SUPERREPEL, :MAXREPEL,
    :GRASSMAIL, :FLAMEMAIL,
    :BUBBLEMAIL, :SPACEMAIL
  ])
end
```

Each individual argument is explained in it's respective Setting Page in this guide.

---
The first command we can add is `speech: "string"` that let us use a [Seller Class](/documentation/poke-market/settings/speeches/seller-classes).
<br/>
```ruby
def pbSomeMart
  pbPokemonMart([
    :POKEBALL, :GREATBALL, :ULTRABALL,
    :ESCAPEROPE,
    :REPEL, :SUPERREPEL, :MAXREPEL,
    :GRASSMAIL, :FLAMEMAIL,
    :BUBBLEMAIL, :SPACEMAIL
  ], speech: "ProSeller")
end
```

The NPC will now use the speeches setup in ProSeller, again this is explained on the [Seller Class](/documentation/poke-market/settings/speeches/seller-classes) page.

---
The second command we can add is `useCat: Boolean` which is either `true` or `false` and let us either enable or disable the [Item Categories](/documentation/poke-market/settings/item-categories).
<br/>
```ruby
def pbSomeMart
  pbPokemonMart([
    :POKEBALL, :GREATBALL, :ULTRABALL,
    :ESCAPEROPE,
    :REPEL, :SUPERREPEL, :MAXREPEL,
    :GRASSMAIL, :FLAMEMAIL,
    :BUBBLEMAIL, :SPACEMAIL
  ], speech: "ProSeller", useCat: true)
end
```

---
The third command we can add is `discount: Number` which refers to a Game Variable ID. This is explained on the [Discounts](/documentation/poke-market/settings/discounts) page.
<br/>
```ruby
def pbSomeMart
  pbPokemonMart([
    :POKEBALL, :GREATBALL, :ULTRABALL,
    :ESCAPEROPE,
    :REPEL, :SUPERREPEL, :MAXREPEL,
    :GRASSMAIL, :FLAMEMAIL,
    :BUBBLEMAIL, :SPACEMAIL
  ], speech: "ProSeller", useCat: true, discount: 26)
end
```

---
The fourth command we can add is `currency: "string` to set the Currency the mart event should use. The current possible values are: `"money"`, `"gold"`, `"coins"`, `"battle points"` and `"bp"` (with of course **money and gold** being the same as well as **battle points and bp**).
<br/>
```ruby
def pbSomeMart
  pbPokemonMart([
    :POKEBALL, :GREATBALL, :ULTRABALL,
    :ESCAPEROPE,
    :REPEL, :SUPERREPEL, :MAXREPEL,
    :GRASSMAIL, :FLAMEMAIL,
    :BUBBLEMAIL, :SPACEMAIL
  ], speech: "ProSeller", useCat: true, discount: 26, currency: "coins")
end
```

---
The fifth command we add is `cantSell: Boolean` to disable Selling (set it to `true`). This is disabled (`false`) by default.
<br/>
```ruby
def pbSomeMart
  pbPokemonMart([
    :POKEBALL, :GREATBALL, :ULTRABALL,
    :ESCAPEROPE,
    :REPEL, :SUPERREPEL, :MAXREPEL,
    :GRASSMAIL, :FLAMEMAIL,
    :BUBBLEMAIL, :SPACEMAIL
  ], speech: "ProSeller", useCat: true, discount: 26, currency: "money", cantSell: true)
end
```

<Callout type="hint">The only settings that can't be used for a Shelf Event are `useCat` and `cantSell`. All the other settings are exactly the same as well as how to apply them.</Callout>
