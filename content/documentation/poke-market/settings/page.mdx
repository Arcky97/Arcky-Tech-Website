## Setup 

Since **v1.4.0**, the way you provide settings to a Mart or Shelf event has changed — and improved!
- You no longer need to worry about the *order* of arguments (except for the item list, which should **always come first**).
- Here's how you'd define a Mart event:

```ruby
def pbSomeMart
  pbPokemonMart([
    :POKEBALL, :GREATBALL, :ULTRABALL,
    :ESCAPEROPE,
    :REPEL, :SUPERREPEL, :MAXREPEL,
    :GRASSMAIL, :FLAMEMAIL,
    :BUBBLEMAIL, :SPACEMAIL
  ])
end
```

Each optional argument is explained below and in more detail on its corresponding Settings page.

---
### speech: "string"
This lets you assign a specific <Ye>Seller Class</Ye> to the event.

```ruby 
  speech: "ProSeller"
```

```ruby
def pbSomeMart
  pbPokemonMart([
    :POKEBALL, :GREATBALL, :ULTRABALL,
    :ESCAPEROPE,
    :REPEL, :SUPERREPEL, :MAXREPEL,
    :GRASSMAIL, :FLAMEMAIL,
    :BUBBLEMAIL, :SPACEMAIL
  ], speech: "ProSeller")
end
```
➡️See [Seller Class](/documentation/poke-market/settings/speeches/seller-classes) for more info.

---
### useCat: true / false
This enables or disables <Bl>Item Categories</Bl>.

```ruby
  useCat: true
```

```ruby
def pbSomeMart
  pbPokemonMart([
    :POKEBALL, :GREATBALL, :ULTRABALL,
    :ESCAPEROPE,
    :REPEL, :SUPERREPEL, :MAXREPEL,
    :GRASSMAIL, :FLAMEMAIL,
    :BUBBLEMAIL, :SPACEMAIL
  ], speech: "ProSeller", useCat: true)
end
```

---
### Discount: number
Use this to apply a discount by refering a Game Variable ID:

```ruby
  discount: 26
```

```ruby
def pbSomeMart
  pbPokemonMart([
    :POKEBALL, :GREATBALL, :ULTRABALL,
    :ESCAPEROPE,
    :REPEL, :SUPERREPEL, :MAXREPEL,
    :GRASSMAIL, :FLAMEMAIL,
    :BUBBLEMAIL, :SPACEMAIL
  ], speech: "ProSeller", useCat: true, discount: 26)
end
```

---
### currency: "string"
Sets which <Ye>currency</Ye> the Mart or Shelf should use.
Valid default values:
- `"money"` or `"gold"`
- `"coins"`
- `"bp"` or `"battle points"`
- `:Item` (new v1.7.0)

<br/>
**Using a Default Currency (none Item)**
```ruby 
  currency: "coins"
```

```ruby
def pbSomeMart
  pbPokemonMart([
    :POKEBALL, :GREATBALL, :ULTRABALL,
    :ESCAPEROPE,
    :REPEL, :SUPERREPEL, :MAXREPEL,
    :GRASSMAIL, :FLAMEMAIL,
    :BUBBLEMAIL, :SPACEMAIL
  ], speech: "ProSeller", useCat: true, discount: 26, currency: "coins")
end
```

<br/>
**Using an Item Currency**
<br/>
If you want to use an Item as the currency for a mart store, this is not *possible since v1.7.0*. 
```ruby 
  currency: ":HEARTSCALE"
```

The one thing you need to **keep in mind** when using an **Item as the Currency** is that you still need to **define the price** for each item. Because otherwise the **default price** will be **1**.

If you're familiar with the item limit system in this plugin then understanding the little code below should not be a problem. 

The **Script** sees the **last element in the array** for an **Item slot** as **the Price**. But **only** when the **Currency** is set to **an Item**. **Otherwise** this will **be the limit** for **Poke balls** if a **Refresh Rate** was given, **if not** this number **will be ignored**.
```ruby
  [:POKEBALL, 5]
```
So now **1 Poke ball** will **cost 5 Heart scales**. But what if you want **1 Poke ball** to **cost 5 Red Shards**. Well then you can do it like this:
```ruby
  [:POKEBALL, [5, :REDSHARD]]
```

Once you did this for the other Items you should get a similar result to this:
```ruby
def pbSomeMart
  pbPokemonMart([
    [:POKEBALL, [5, :REDSHARD]], [:GREATBALL, [10, :REDSHARD]], [:ULTRABALL, [20, :REDSHARD]],
    [:ESCAPEROPE, 8],
    [:REPEL, [3, :YELLOWSHARD]], [:SUPERREPEL, [7, :YELLOWSHARD]], [:MAXREPEL, [15, :YELLOWSHARD]],
    [:GRASSMAIL, 4], [:FLAMEMAIL, 4],
    [:BUBBLEMAIL, 4], [:SPACEMAIL, 6]
  ], speech: "ProSeller", useCat: true, discount: 26, currency: :HEARTSCALE)
end
```

Or when you're using the Item Limit System as well:
```ruby
def pbSomeMart
  pbPokemonMart(["2daily",
    [:POKEBALL, 10, 15, [5, :REDSHARD]], [:GREATBALL, 12, 16, [10, :REDSHARD]], [:ULTRABALL, 15, 18, [20, :REDSHARD]],
    [:ESCAPEROPE, 1, 8],
    [:REPEL, 20, 25, [3, :YELLOWSHARD]], [:SUPERREPEL, 15, [7, :YELLOWSHARD]], [:MAXREPEL, 12, [15, :YELLOWSHARD]],
    [:GRASSMAIL, 5, 4], [:FLAMEMAIL, 5, 4],
    [:BUBBLEMAIL, 5, 4], [:SPACEMAIL, 3, 6]
  ], speech: "ProSeller", useCat: true, discount: 26, currency: :HEARTSCALE)
end
```

<Callout type="attention">
  **<Rd>Very important</Rd>** is that **first comes the Price** and **then the Currency**. If you **only put the Currency** then this will be **ignored**.
  You can also not set the Item specific Currency to a none Item Currency, this will give you a warning in the console and will be ignored to prevent issues. 
</Callout>

### cantSell: true / false 
Disables the ability to sell items in this event.
This is *optional* and defaults to `false` (meaning selling is allowed).

```ruby 
  cantSell: true
```

```ruby
def pbSomeMart
  pbPokemonMart([
    :POKEBALL, :GREATBALL, :ULTRABALL,
    :ESCAPEROPE,
    :REPEL, :SUPERREPEL, :MAXREPEL,
    :GRASSMAIL, :FLAMEMAIL,
    :BUBBLEMAIL, :SPACEMAIL
  ], speech: "ProSeller", useCat: true, discount: 26, currency: "money", cantSell: true)
end
```

---
### billEnd: true / false 
If enabled, the Mart event will end after paying the bill.

```ruby
  billEnd: true
```

```ruby 
def pbSomeMart
  pbPokemonMart([
    :POKEBALL, :GREATBALL, :ULTRABALL,
    :ESCAPEROPE,
    :REPEL, :SUPERREPEL, :MAXREPEL,
    :GRASSMAIL, :FLAMEMAIL,
    :BUBBLEMAIL, :SPACEMAIL
  ], speech: "ProSeller", useCat: true, discount: 26, currency: "money", cantSell: true, billEnd: true)
end
```

--- 
### random: ["string", number]
Use this to select a specific or random amount of items from the given item list. 
- The first element is the refresh time for items to be repicked randomly. 
- The second element is the amount of items you want to be selected randomly.
<br/>
Allowed refresh times are the same as the Refresh Rate for Item Limits with exception for `"random"` not being supported.
<br/>
- select a fixed amount.

```ruby 
  random: ["daily", 4]
```

- select a random amount.
```ruby
  random: ["daily", rand(1..4)]
```

```ruby 
def pbSomeMart
  pbPokemonMart([
    :POKEBALL, :GREATBALL, :ULTRABALL,
    :ESCAPEROPE,
    :REPEL, :SUPERREPEL, :MAXREPEL,
    :GRASSMAIL, :FLAMEMAIL,
    :BUBBLEMAIL, :SPACEMAIL
  ], speech: "ProSeller", useCat: true, discount: 26, currency: "money", cantSell: true, billEnd: true, random: ["daily", rand(1..4)])
end
```
