  How to create Custom Item Categories.

The Custom Item Categories is where the fun begins.
<br/>
```ruby
 CustomCategoryNames = {
  "Evolution Stones" => { 
    :items => [:FIRESTONE, :THUNDERSTONE, :WATERSTONE, :LEAFSTONE, :MOONSTONE, :SUNSTONE, :DUSKSTONE, :DAWNSTONE, :SHINYSTONE, :ICESTONE],
    :order => 11
  },
  "Type Plates" => {
    :items => [:FLAMEPLATE, :SPLASHPLATE, :ZAPPLATE, :MEADOWPLATE, :ICICLEPLATE, :FISTPLATE, :TOXICPLATE, :EARTHPLATE, :SKYPLATE, :MINDPLATE, :INSECTPLATE, :STONEPLATE, :SPOOKYPLATE, :DRACOPLATE, :DREADPLATE, :IRONPLATE, :PIXIEPLATE],
    :order => 12
  },
  "Type Gems" => {
    :items => [:FIREGEM, :WATERGEM, :ELECTRICGEM, :GRASSGEM, :ICEGEM, :FIGHTINGGEM, :POISONGEM, :GROUNDGEM, :FLYINGGEM, :PSYCHICGEM, :BUGGEM, :ROCKGEM, :GHOSTGEM, :DRAGONGEM, :DARKGEM, :STEELGEM, :FAIRYGEM, :NORMALGEM],
    :order => 13
  }
}
```

I've provided some examples already. One of these examples is **"Evolution Stones"** which is a hash that has a key named `:items` which is an array that contains all the Evolution Stone Items. You can also provide an `:order` key which will cort the Categories accordingly.
<br/>
The Default Category's `:order` is their pocket ID * 10. If you added custom Pocket names to the bag, you can know the `:order`by doing the same calculation (Pocket ID * 10).
<br/>
- "Items" => order = 10
- "Medicine" => order = 20
- "PokÃ© Balls" => order = 30
- "TMs & HMs" => order = 40
- "Berries" => order = 50
- "Mail" => order = 60
- "Battle Items" => order = 70
- "Key Items" => order = 80
<br/>
The result in game will be as follow:

Since we assigned 11 to `:order`, the **"Evolution stones"** Category will be placed after the **"Items"** Category.
<br/>
But in this example there are no items that belong to the **"Items"** Category (for this Mart Event) so the first Category shown is the "Evolution Stones" Category. The next Category will then be **"Type Plates"** and then **"Type Gems"** since they have an respective `:order` of 12 and 13.
<br/>
The Category there after is **"Medicine"** if there are items that belong to this Category (for this Mart Event).
<br/>
In other words it just follows up the number of the `:order` assigned.
<br/>
If you don't provide an `:order` for your custom category, it'll be the last one in the list. (Unless it's the only category).
