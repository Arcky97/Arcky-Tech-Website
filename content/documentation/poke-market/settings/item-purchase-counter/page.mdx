  How to use the Item Purchase Counter Setting.
</Header>

The **Item Purchase Counter** is a new setting introduced in **v1.5.0**. It allows you to track how many of a specific item (or group of items) the player has purchased across **any** Mart event.
<br/>
Set it up like this:
<br/>
```ruby
ItemPurchaseCounter = {
  101 => [:POKEBALL, :GREATBALL, :ULTRABALL],
  102 => [:POTION, :SUPERPOTION, :HYPERPOTION]
}
```

- `101` = The Variable ID that will store the total number of purchases for the specified items.
  - The value is an array of item IDs to track.
    - `:POKEBALL`, `:GREATBALL`, `:ULTRABALL` = These item purchases will all add to variable 101.
- `102` = Tracks purchases of Potions into variable 102, and so on.

<Callout type="hint">
  You can include as many items as you like in each array. Items can appear in **multiple** arrays if needed.
</Callout>

If this becomes a popular feature, I may add shortcuts for common categories â€” for example, `"Balls"` to include all types of Poke Ball items, or `"TMs"` for all TMs in your game.
