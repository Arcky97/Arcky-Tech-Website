<Header title="Stock Items for Items">
  How to use the StockItems setting for regular Items.
</Header>

The **Stock Items** is a new setting introduced in **v1.6.0**. It allows you to manage Items for several stores more easily and reuse a same stock of Item across several Mart or Shelf events.
<br/>
--- 
## Example 1 
### Setting Setup
```ruby 
StockItems = {
  :normalStore => [
    :POKEBALL, :GREATBALL, :ULTRABALL,
    :POTION, :SUPERPOTION, :HYPERPOTION, :MAXPOTION,
    :FULLRESTORE, :REVIVE,
    :REPEL, :SUPERREPEL, :MAXREPEL,
    :ANTIDOTE, :BURNHEAL, :ICEHEAL, :AWAKENING, :PARALYZEHEAL, :FULLHEAL
  ]
}
```
- `:normalStore` — The name of the stock.
  - An Array of Items for this stock.

### Usage in a Mart event 
To use it in your Mart or Shelf event, you type the name of the stock but as a string instead of a hash.
<br/>
```ruby 
def pbSomeMart
  pbPokemonMart("normalStore", speech: "ProSeller", discount: 29, useCat: true, billEnd: true)
end
```

## Example 2
### Setting Setup 
```ruby 
StockItems = {
  :limitStore => ["daily",
    [:POKEBALL, 10, 18], [:GREATBALL, 12, 16], [:ULTRABALL, 8, 15],
    :POTION, :SUPERPOTION, :HYPERPOTION, :MAXPOTION,
    [:FULLRESTORE, 20, 25], :REVIVE,
    :REPEL, [:SUPERREPEL, 20], :MAXREPEL
  ]
}
```
- `:limitStore` — The name of the stock.
  - An Array of Items for this stock. But this time they include Item Limits as well.

### Usage in a Mart event 
```ruby
def pbSomeShelf
  pbShelfMart("limitStore", speech: "ShelfOne", discount: 29)
end
```
