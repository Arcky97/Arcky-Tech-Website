  How to use the StockItems setting for Species
</Header>

The **Stock Items** settings can also be used for Species events. The Usage in the event is the same as for the Mart and Shelf events but for defining a Species, there are a lot of parameters that you can apply.
<br/>
### Simple Version 

```ruby 
StockItems = {
  :pokemonStore => [
    {
      name: :BULBASAUR, 
      price: 9500,
      level: 15
    },
    {
      name: :CHARMANDER,
      price: 9500,
      level: 15
    },
    {
      name: :SQUIRTLE,
      price: 9500,
      level: 15
    }
  ]
}
```
There is only 1 required parameter for each species:
- `name:` — The ID of the species 
The others are all optional
- `price` — The price for the species 
- `level` — The level the species is sold as.
<br/>
---

### Extended Version
Like mentioned in the Simple Version, all the parameters in the Extended Version are optional, this is only the craziest setup for a Species that you can go with.
