<Header title="Bonus Items">
  How to add Bonus Items for an Item.
</Header>

This feature allows you to set up Bonus Items for **any item**, not just Poké Balls (like the default in Essentials).
<br/>Bonus Items apply to all shops where that item is sold.
<br/>They are only granted if the purchased item is found in the `BonusItems` setting.
<br/>
---

## Example 1 — Basic 

A simple structure where you define a required amount to receive a bonus item.

```ruby
BonusItems = {
  :POKEBALL => {
    :amount => 10,
    :item => :PREMIERBALL
  }
}
```

- `:POKEBALL` — The item you need to buy in quantity.
  - `:amount => 10` — For every 10 Poké Balls purchased...
  - `:item => :PREMIERBALL` — ...you get 1 Premier Ball.

*Exactly like the default in Essentials.*

<Callout type="hint">
  <Bl>Only for Ball Items</Bl>: If the bought item is a Ball (like Great Ball), this rule will apply unless you define a specific entry for that item.
</Callout>

<br/>
## Example 2 — Randomized Multiple Items 

An expanded version that allows random bonus selection, optionally with specific chances.

```ruby
BonusItems = {
  :GREATBALL => {
    :amount => 10,
    :item => [
      [:GREATBALL, 20],
      :PREMIERBALL
    ]
  }
}
```

- For every 10 Great Balls bought:
  - 20% chance of getting another Great Ball
  - 80% chance of getting a Premier Ball

If no chances are given, the items are equally weighted.

<Callout type="hint">
  If only some items have defined chances, the remaining percentage is split evenly among the rest.
</Callout>
<br/>
---

## Example 3 — Advanced: Amount + Chances

The most flexible setup: different item amounts and chances.

```ruby
BonusItems = {     
  :ULTRABALL => {
    :amount => 5,
    :item => {
      :PREMIERBALL => {
        :amount => 3
      },
      :MASTERBALL => { 
        :chance => 0.1 
      },
      :ULTRABALL => {
        :amount => 2,
        :chance => 5
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- For every 5 Ultra Balls bought:
  - 0.1% chance to get a Master Ball
  - 5% chance to get 2 Ultra Balls 
  - Remaining chance to get a Premier Ball

<Callout type="attention">
  When using this format, each bonus item must have at least `:amount` or `:chance` defined.
  <br/>If not, use the format shown in Example 2 instead.
