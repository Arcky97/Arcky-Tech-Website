<Header title="Badges for Items">
  How to Limit an Item to a certain amount of Badges.
</Header>

In default Essentials, managing which items are available in a Mart based on badge count requires setting up separate item lists for each scenario.
<br/>This plugin simplifies that process with a dedicated setting: `BadgesForItems`
<ImageWithCaption src="/images/documentation/poke-market/Default Mart Event for Badges.png" caption="Default Mart Event for Badges" align="left"/>

<Callout type="hint">
  Introduced in v1.6.0 â€” there's a new setting `BadgesForSpecies`, which can only be used for Species events. The setup is completely the same as for `BadgesForItems` with exceptions you should specify Species instead of Items.
</Callout>
---

### The Easy Way with `BadgesForItems`

Use the following setup in your `000_PokeMarket_Settings_and_Setup.rb` file:

```ruby
BadgesForItems = {
  1 => [:GREATBALL, :SUPERPOTION, :ANTIDOTE, :PARALYZEHEAL, :AWAKENING, :BURNHEAL, :ICEHEAL, :REPEL, :ESCAPEROPE],
  3 => [:HYPERPOTION, :SUPERREPEL, :REVIVE],
  5 => [:ULTRABALL, :FULLHEAL, :MAXREPEL],
  7 => [:MAXPOTION],
  8 => [:FULLRESTORE]
}
```

Each key in the hash represents a badge requirement.
<br/>Once the player has at least that many badges, the associated **items** become available for purchase.
<Callout type="hint">
  This system is similar to how HMs unlock with badge milestones â€” but event better, you can also configure the specific badge ID if needed.
</Callout>

### Items Available from the Start 

Any items **not listed** in the `BadgesForItems` hash will be available by default, with 0 badges.

### Example Usage 

Let's say we define a Mart like this:

```ruby
def pbSomeMart
  pbPokemonMart([
    :POKEBALL, :GREATBALL, :ULTRABALL,
    :POTION, :SUPERPOTION, :HYPERPOTION, :MAXPOTION,
    :FULLRESTORE, :REVIVE,
    :ANTIDOTE, :PARALYZEHEAL, :AWAKENING, :BURNHEAL, :ICEHEAL,
    :FULLHEAL,
    :REPEL, :SUPERREPEL, :MAXREPEL
  ], useCat: true)
end
```

Now simply call `pbSomeMart` in your event using a script command.

### Result in Game 

ðŸ”’ With 0 Badges:
<ImageWithCaption src="/images/documentation/poke-market/0 Badges Item Category 1.png" caption="No Badges Item Category 1" align="left"/>
<ImageWithCaption src="/images/documentation/poke-market/0 Badges Item Category 2.png" caption="No Badges Item Category 2" align="left"/>

ðŸ”“ With 1 Badge:
<ImageWithCaption src="/images/documentation/poke-market/1 Badge Item Category 1.png" caption="1 Badge Item Category 1" align="left"/>
<ImageWithCaption src="/images/documentation/poke-market/1 Badge Item Category 2.png" caption="1 Badge Item Category 2" align="left"/>
<ImageWithCaption src="/images/documentation/poke-market/1 Badge Item Category 3.png" caption="1 Badge Item Category 3" align="left"/>
<ImageWithCaption src="/images/documentation/poke-market/1 Badge Item Category 4.png" caption="1 Badge Item Category 4" align="left"/>

As shown, once a badge treshold is crossed, all items defined at or below that level become available.
<br/>For example, reaching 3 badges will unlock:

```ruby
  [:HYPERPOTION, :SUPERREPEL, :REVIVE]
```
...and so on, all the way to 8 or more badges.
