  How to add an apply discounts to items.
</Header>

This feature allows you to apply discounts to all items in a store.
<br/>Currently, there's no way to exclude specific items - but that migiht change in the future.
<br/>
```ruby
def pbSomeMart
  pbPokemonMart([
    :POKEBALL, :GREATBALL, :ULTRABALL,
    :POTION, :SUPERPOTION, :HYPERPOTION, :MAXPOTION,
    :FULLRESTORE, :REVIVE,
    :ANTIDOTE, :PARALYZEHEAL, :AWAKENING, :BURNHEAL, :ICEHEAL,
    :FULLHEAL,
    :REPEL, :SUPERREPEL, :MAXREPEL,
    :ESCAPEROPE
  ], useCat: true, discount: 27)
end
```

To enable discounts, add `discount:` followed by a Game Variable ID.
<br/>
You can set up discounts in three ways:

---

## First way - Game Variable + Array

Use a Game Variable and assign it an array of percentage values (e.g., `4` = 4% discount).
<br/>
```ruby
DISCOUNTS = {
  27 => [0, 1, 4, 7, 11]
}
```
- `27` is the Game Variable ID.
- The array values are used base on the variable's value (treated as an index).

<MarkdownTable
  headers={["Game Variable", "Discount Used"]}
  rows={[
    [0, "0%"],
    [1, "-1%"],
    [2, "-4%"],
    [3, "-7%"],
    [4, "-11%"]
  ]}
/>

<EmblaCarousel
  slides={[
    "documentation/poke-market/ItemDiscount Ex1-1",
    "documentation/poke-market/ItemDiscount Ex1-2",
    "documentation/poke-market/ItemDiscount Ex1-3",
    "documentation/poke-market/ItemDiscount Ex1-4",
    "documentation/poke-market/ItemDiscount Ex1-5"
  ]}
  captions={[
    "0% Discount",
    "1% Discount",
    "4% Discount",
    "7% Discount",
    "11% Discount" 
  ]}
  options={{ loop: true }}
/>

<Callout type="hint">
  Each value in the array is accessed by index. If the variable is set too high and the index doesn't exist, you'll be warned in-game.
</Callout>

---

## Second way - Item + Game Variable(s)

You can combine an **item requirement** with one or more **Game Variables**.

<br/>
```ruby
DISCOUNTS = {
  :COUPONA => { 
    26 => [0, 3, 6, 8, 10],
    28 => [0, -2, -5] 
  },
}
```

- Player must have the `:COUPONA` item.
- Each key (`26`, `28`) is a Game Variable ID.
- Negative values are allowed - they <Bl>result</Bl> is **overcharges**.
<br/>
### Example for Variable 26:

<MarkdownTable
  headers={["Game Variable", "Discount Used"]}
  rows={[
    [0, "0%"],
    [1, "-3%"],
    [2, "-6%"],
    [3, "-8%"],
    [4, "-10%"]
  ]}
/>

<EmblaCarousel 
  slides={[
    "documentation/poke-market/ItemDiscount Ex2-1",
    "documentation/poke-market/ItemDiscount Ex2-2",
    "documentation/poke-market/ItemDiscount Ex2-3",
    "documentation/poke-market/ItemDiscount Ex2-4",
    "documentation/poke-market/ItemDiscount Ex2-5"
  ]}
  captions={[
    "0% Discount",
    "3% Discount",
    "6% Discount",
    "8% Discount",
    "10% Discount"
  ]}
  options={{ loop: true }}
/>
<br/>
### Example for Variable 28 (Overcharges):

<MarkdownTable
  headers={["Game Variable", "Overchage Used"]}
  rows={[
    [0, "0%"],
    [1, "+2%"],
    [2, "+5%"]
  ]}
/>

<EmblaCarousel
  slides={[
    "documentation/poke-market/ItemDiscount Ex3-1",
    "documentation/poke-market/ItemDiscount Ex3-2",
    "documentation/poke-market/ItemDiscount Ex3-3"
  ]}
  captions={[
    "0% Overcharge",
    "2% Overcharge",
    "5% Overcharge"  
  ]}
  options={{ loop: true }}
/>
<br/>

You can  combine discount and overcharge values - just be careful not to duplicate the same Game Variable ID under the same item, or you may get unpredictable results.
<br/>
### Example - Scaling Discounts and Overcharges

```ruby
DISCOUNTS = {
  29 => [10, 8, 6, 4, 2, 0, -2, -4, -6, -8, -10, -12]
}
```
Or with an item requirement:
<br/>
```ruby
DISCOUNTS = {
  :COUPONB => {
    29 => [10, 8, 6, 4, 2, 0, -2, -4, -6, -8, -10, -12]
  }
}
```

This lets you gradually reduce a player's discount the more they do something (e.g. blacking out), and eventually start overcharging.
<br/>
- Player must have the `:COUPONB` item.
- Each key (`29`) is a Game Variable ID.
<br/>
<MarkdownTable
  headers={["Game Variable", "Discount/Overcharge Used"]}
  rows={[
    [0, "-10%"],
    [1, "-8%"],
    [2, "-6%"],
    [3, "-4%"],
    [4, "-2%"],
    [5, "0%"],
    [6, "+2%"],
    [7, "+4%"],
    [8, "+6%"],
    [9, "+8%"],
    [10, "+10%"],
    [11, "+12%"]
  ]}
/>

    "documentation/poke-market/ItemDiscount Ex4-2",
    "documentation/poke-market/ItemDiscount Ex4-3",
    "documentation/poke-market/ItemDiscount Ex4-4",
    "documentation/poke-market/ItemDiscount Ex4-5",

  ]}
  captions={[
    "10% Discount",
    "8% Discount",
    "6% Discount",
    "4% Discount",
    "2% Discount",
    "0% Discount",
    "2% Overcharge",
    "4% Overcharge",
    "6% Overcharge",
    "8% Overcharge",
    "10% Overcharge",
    "12% Overcharge"
  ]}
  options={{ loop: true }}
/>

## Third way - Direct Value Use 

This method skips the array setup and uses the Game Variable's **actual value** as the discount or overchage.
<br/>
So `discount: 30` will directly pull the value of Game Variable 30.
<br/>
- 10 = 10% discount 
- -5 = 5% overcharge 
- 0 = no change 
<br/>
This gives you more flexibility and lets you reuse the same variable across different Mart events.
