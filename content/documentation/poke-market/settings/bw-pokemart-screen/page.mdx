  Support for the BW PokéMart Screen Graphic Plugin.

This is simple setting to turn on when you're using the [BW PokéMart Screen Plugin](https://eeveeexpo.com/resources/904/) from DeepBlue.
<br/>
```ruby
UseBWGraphicsPlugin = true
```

<Callout type="attention">When installing this plugin, only install the Graphics and not the plugin folder included with that plugin or it'll collide with my plugin. All changes needed are included in my plugin so all you need to do is set the Setting above to `true`.</Callout>
