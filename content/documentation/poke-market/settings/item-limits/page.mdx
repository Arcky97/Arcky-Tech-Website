  How to enable and use Item Limits.

  ---
</header>
This plugin offers teh possibility to limit the amount of an Item you can buy. With this you can choose the restock time as well.
<br/>
For the Refresh Time there are the following options (they are case insensitive):
- `"daily"`
- `"2daily"`
- `"weekly"`
- `"random"` (between 1 and 7 days)
- `"never"` (no restocking)
<br/>
```ruby
def pbSomeMart
  pbPokemonMart(["Daily",
    [:POKEBALL, 15, 20], [:GREATBALL, 10, 15], [:ULTRABALL, 5, 10],
    [:POTION, 10, 15], [:SUPERPOTION, 8, 12], [:HYPERPOTION, 5, 8], [:MAXPOTION, 2, 5],
    :FULLRESTORE, [:REVIVE, 1, 4],
    [:ANTIDOTE, 5], :PARALYZEHEAL, :AWAKENING, :BURNHEAL, :ICEHEAL,
    :FULLHEAL,
    :REPEL, :SUPERREPEL, :MAXREPEL,
    :ESCAPEROPE
  ], useCat: true)
end
```

Each Item that you want to have a limit needs to be in it's own array `[]` including the item, a minimum and optionally a maximum value.
- When you provide a minimum and maximum value, the limit amount will be a random number between this minimum and maximum value generated by the script.
- When you don't provide a maximum value, the maximum value will be equal to the minimum value so the limit amount will always be the same.
- When you don't want a limit at all for an item, leave it as it is (so without `[]`).

The max we can buy is 11, so once we buy this amount, the item will be out of stock.

Whne we would try to buy this item again, it would give us a message saying how long we have to wait for a restock.
<br/>
This depends on the days that have passed since the Item is out of stock and the Refresh Time you have set for this mart.

<Callout type="hint">If you want to quickly restock all stores, you can use `forcePokemonMartRefresh` to refresh the stock of all stores. But this is only for testing.</Callout>
