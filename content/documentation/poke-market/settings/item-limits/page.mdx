  How to enable and use Item Limits.
</Header>

This plugin allows you to limit how many of a specific item can be purchased from a Mart — and define how often that stock refreshes.
<br/>
You can control the **restock frequency** using one of these options (case-insensitive):
<br/>
<MarkdownTable
  headers={["Setting", "Time"]}
  rows={[
    [<code>"daily"</code>, "every day"],
    [<code>"2daily"</code>, "every 2 days"],
    [<code>"weekly"</code>, "every week"],
    [<code>"random"</code>, "between 1 and 7 days"],
    [<code>"never"</code>, "no restocking"]
  ]}
/>

<br/>

## Example Setup 

Here's a Mart event that uses various item limits:
<br/>
```ruby
def pbSomeMart
  pbPokemonMart(["Daily",
    [:POKEBALL, 15, 20], [:GREATBALL, 10, 15], [:ULTRABALL, 5, 10],
    [:POTION, 10, 15], [:SUPERPOTION, 8, 12], [:HYPERPOTION, 5, 8], [:MAXPOTION, 2, 5],
    :FULLRESTORE, [:REVIVE, 1, 4],
    [:ANTIDOTE, 5], :PARALYZEHEAL, :AWAKENING, :BURNHEAL, :ICEHEAL,
    :FULLHEAL,
    :REPEL, :SUPERREPEL, :MAXREPEL,
    :ESCAPEROPE
  ], useCat: true)
end
```
<br/>

## How it works

- Each **limited item** must be wrapped in an array: `[itemID, min, max (optional)]`.
- If you give both `min` and `max`, the available quantity is chosen randomly between those numbers.
- If you only give `min`, then the limit (for that item) is always exactly that number.
- If you want an **unlimited** item, just list it normally (like `:FULLRESTORE` or `:ESCAPEROPE`).

### Visual Example

<ImageWithCaption src="/images/documentation/poke-market/Item Limit Max Buyable.png" caption="Item Limit Max Buyable" align="left"/>
The Screenshot above shows the maximum we can buy — in this case, 11.
<br/>Once you reach this number...
<ImageWithCaption src="/images/documentation/poke-market/Item Limit Out of Stock.png" caption="Item Limit Out of Stock" align="left"/>
...the item becomes unavailable and shows an "Out of Stock" message:
<ImageWithCaption src="/images/documentation/poke-market/Item Limit Out of Stock Message.png" caption="Item Limit Out of Stock Message" align="left"/>
The message tells the player how long to wait for a restock, depending on the refresh setting you used (`"daily"`, `"2daily"`, etc.).

<Callout type="hint">
  To instantly restock **all Marts** (useful for testing), run this in a script: `forcePokemonMartRefresh`
