  How to set up a Mart event.
</Header>

## Mart Event
The script command **<Gn>hasn't changed</Gn>** â€” but as of **<Gn>v1.4.0</Gn>**, you can now provide *extra arguments*, which means the full command can get quite large.
<br/>
Here's how a basic setup would look inside an event:

```ruby
pbPokemonMart([
  :POKEBALL, :GREATBALL, :ULTRABALL,
  :ESCAPEROPE, 
  :REPEL, :SUPERREPEL, :MAXREPEL, 
  :GRASSMAIL, :FLAMEMAIL, 
  :BUBBLEMAIL, :SPACEMAIL
])
```

If your list of items gets too long, there's a much cleaner way to organize it using a helper method.
<Callout type="hint">
  You can define a method in the `000_PokeMarket_Settings_and_Setup.rb` file to clean up your event commands.
</Callout>
For example, at the bottom of that file, add:

```ruby 
def pbSomeMart
  pbPokemonMart([
    :POKEBALL, :GREATBALL, :ULTRABALL,
    :ESCAPEROPE,
    :REPEL, :SUPERREPEL, :MAXREPEL,
    :GRASSMAIL, :FLAMEMAIL,
    :BUBBLEMAIL, :SPACEMAIL 
  ])
end
```
Now inside your event, you only need to call:

```ruby
  pbSomeMart
```
<Callout type="hint">
  Using methods like this helps you:
    - <Gn>Reuse item lists</Gn> across multiple events
    - <Gn>Quickly update</Gn> all associated events by changing just one method 
    - <Gn>Keep your event clean</Gn> and easier to manage
