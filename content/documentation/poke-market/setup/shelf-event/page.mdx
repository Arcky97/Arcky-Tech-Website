  How to set up a Shelf event.
</Header>

## Shelf Event
Setting up a Shelf event is essentially the same as a regular Mart event — but with one key difference: you use `pbShelfMart` instead of `pbPokemonMart`.
<br/>
For easier reusability and organization, it's recommended to define your shelf's item list as a method.
<br/>
In the `000_PokeMarket_Settings_and_Setup.rb` file, add the following at the bottom:
<br/>(use *Nodepad++* or any code editor to modify this file)
<br/>
```ruby
def pbSomeShelf
  pbShelfMart([:POTION, :SUPERPOTION,
    :POKEBALL, :GREATBALL,
    :REPEL, :ETHER,
    :ANTIDOTE, :BURNHEAL, :ICEHEAL, :AWAKENING, :PARALYZEHEAL 
  ])
end 
```
<Callout type="attention"> 
  **<Rd>Important:</Rd>** The UI can only show **up to 18 items** at once. 
  <br/>If you add more than 18, only the first 18 will be displayed — the rest will be ignored.
  </Callout>

Inside your Shelf event, simply call the method like this:
<br/>
```ruby
  pbSomeShelf 
```
This makes it easier to reuse item lists across different shelves and apply changes globally by just updating the method once.
