  # Setting up a Shelf Event

## Shelf Event
The way of setting up the Shelf Event is basically the same as how to do it for the Mart Events. I do recommend doing it like following so it's easier to reuse the same items for a shelf or apply changes to multiple events at once.
<br/>
In the `000_PokeMart_Settings_and_Setup` file you can add this at the bottom (use notepad ++ or any other code editor program to edit this file):
<br/>
```ruby
def pbSomeShelf
  pbShelfMart([:POTION, :SUPERPOTION,
    :POKEBALL, :GREATBALL,
    :REPEL, :ETHER,
    :ANTIDOTE, :BURNHEAL, :ICEHEAL, :AWAKENING, :PARALYZEHEAL 
  ])
end 
```
<Callout type="hint">Just keep in mind that the default limit is 18 items that can show up at once on the UI. If you add more than 18, only the first 18 will be shown, the rest will be ignored.</Callout>

Inside the Shelf Event you only need to put `pbSomeShelf` or whatever you named the method.
