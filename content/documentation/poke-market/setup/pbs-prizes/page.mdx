## PBS File
The plugin now supports the `BPPrices` parameter for an iteme in the PBS file. For example, you can add a `BPPrice` and `CoinPrice` for Pokeballs.
<br/>
```plaintext
[POKEBALL]
Name = Poké Ball 
NamePlural = Poké Balls 
Pocket = 3
Price = 200
BPPrice = 50
CoinPrice = 35
BattleUse = OnFoe
Flags = Pokeball
Description = A device for catching wild Pokémon.
It is thrown like a ball at the target. It is designed as a capsule system.
```
<Callout type="hint">If the Currency has been set to `"BP"` (or `"Battle Points"`) for a store, it'll use the `BPPrice` (there's no fallback so make sure all items have a `BPPrice` defined or the Default price is 1 BP)
Same goed for when the Currency has been set to `"Coins"` for a store, it'll use the `CoinPrice` (default is aflso 1 Coin if not set for an item.)</Callout>

You can also specifiy a `SellBPPrice` and/or `SellCoinPrice`. Default is, like with the normal Price, `BPPrice / 2` (for Battle Points) and `CoinPrice / 2` (for coins). You might not need it but it's there just in case.

You can also change these new parameters in the PBS editor in the debug mode.
