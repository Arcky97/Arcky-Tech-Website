  # BP and Coin Prizes (new v1.4.1)

## PBS File
The plugin now supports the use of `BPPrice` and `CoinPrice` within the PBS file.
For example, you can define alternate currency prices for items like Poké Balls:
<br/>
```plaintext
[POKEBALL]
Name = Poké Ball 
NamePlural = Poké Balls 
Pocket = 3
Price = 200
BPPrice = 50
CoinPrice = 35
BattleUse = OnFoe
Flags = Pokeball
Description = A device for catching wild Pokémon.
It is thrown like a ball at the target. It is designed as a capsule system.
```
<Callout type="hint">
  If the store's currency is set to `"BP"` (or `"Battle Points"`), it will use the `BPPrice` for each item. 
  <br/>**There's no fallback**, so make sure every item has a `BPPrice` defined — otherwise the default price will be <Gn>1 BP</Gn>.
  Likewise, if the currency is set to `"Coins`, the item will use its `CoinPrice` value. 
  <br/>Again, if `CoinPrice` is not defined, the default is <Gn>1 Coin</Gn>.
</Callout>

You can also optionally define:
- `SellBPPrice`
- `SellCoinPrice`

<br/>if left undefined, they will default to:
- `BPPrice / 2` for Battle Points 
- `CoinPrice / 2` for Coins. 
You may not need to override them, but the option is there if required.

These parameters can also be edited directly using the **PBS Editor** in <Gn>Debug Mode</Gn>.
