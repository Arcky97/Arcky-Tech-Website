  How to set up a Species event.
</Header>

## Species Event
Setting up a Species event is essnetially the same as a regular Mart event — or Shelf event — but with one key difference: you use `pbSpeciesMart` instead of `pbPokemonMart` or `pbShelfMart`.
<br/>
For easier reusability and organization, it's recommended to define your species list as a method.
<br/>
in the `000_PokeMarket_Settings_and_Setup.rb` file, add the following at the bottom:
<br/>(Use *Notepad++* or any code editor to modify this file)
<br/>
```ruby
def pbSomeSpeciesMart
  pbSpeciesMart([
    { name: :GROWLITHE, price: 11000, level: 25 },
    { name: :BULBASAUR, price: 9500, level: 15 },
    { name: :CHARMANDER, price: 9500, level: 15 },
    { name: :SQUIRTLE, price: 9500, level: 15 },
    { name: :PIKACHU, price: 8500, level: 20}
  ])
end 
```
