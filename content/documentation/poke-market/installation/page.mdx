## Installing the Plugin 
The installation for this plugin is very simple but has changed a bit since v1.4.0 as it now comes with a few custom graphics you might want to install as well.
<br/>
1. Extract the Zip file using any Extractor tool.
2. Open the extracted folder and you'll see these 2 folders: <ImageWithCaption src="/images/documentation/poke-market/Installation 1.png"/>
3. Copy the Plugins folder into your game's root folder. <br/> It shouldn't ask to replace anything if this is the first time installing the plugin. But if it's not the first time, make sure to take a back up of the `000_PokeMarket_Settings_and_Setup.rb` file as you probably don't want your settings to be replaced by the default one.
4. Inside the Graphics folder you'll see 2 folders: <ImageWithCaption src="/images/documentation/poke-market/Installation 2.png"/>
5. Open the folder of the Essentails Version you're using and copy the Graphics folder into your game's Root folder.
6. When launching your game, start a new save.
<br/>
That's it, you've now successfully intalled the plugin.
