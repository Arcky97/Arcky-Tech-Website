## Installing the Plugin 

The installation process is very simple, but has changed slightly since **v1.4.0** — the plugin now includes a few custom graphics you might want to install as well.
<br/>
1. **Extract the ZIP file**
    <br/><Gy>Use any extractor tool (like WinRAR or 7-Zip).</Gy>
2. **Open the extracted folder**
    <br/><Gy>You'll see these two folders:</Gy>

3. **Copy the `Plugins` folder**
    <br/><Gy>Into your game’s root directory.</Gy>
    <Callout type="warning">
      If this is your first time installing the plugin, there should be *no overwrite prompt*.
      However, if you're updating or reinstalling, **make sure to back up** your `000_PokeMarket_Settings_and_Setup.rb` file, as it contains your custom settings and could be overwritten by the default one.

4. **Open the `Graphics` folder**
   <br/><Gy>You’ll see two folders based on the Essentials version:</Gy>
   <ImageWithCaption src="/images/documentation/poke-market/Installation 2.png" align="left"/>

    <br/><Gy>And copy the contents of the `Graphics` folder into your game’s root folder.</Gy>
