### New Feature
- It is now possible to have the player shop items from shelves, stack up their bill and make them pay at the counter before leaving the market.
<br/>
### Bug Fixes
- Fixed a typo on checking the currency, changed "pb" to "bp" (short for Battle Points).
- Added a warning message when no refresh rate is assigned for items with a limit.
<br/>
### Improvements
- Changed the way the script expects arguments (see [Settings and Setup file](settings) for more information).
- Added a new Setting `BillSwitch` which is the Switch ID that is enabled when there are items in the player's basket. This can be used to prevent the player from leaving the mart through eventing.
