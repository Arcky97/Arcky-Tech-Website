### New Feature
- You can now track how many of a specified item or items a player has bought over time, from any mart event.
<br/>
### Bug Fixes
- Fixed a bug with the store restocking after paying the bill (when using the shelf events).
- Fixed a crash when calling the `forcePokemonMartRefresh` method twice in a row.
- Fixed another crash after using the `forcePokemonMartRefresh` method and there would be a bill left to pay. 
<br/>
### Improvements
- Using `forcePokemonMartRefresh` will not only restock items in all stores (expect the stores using a mart event with a refresh rate `"never"`) but also reset the items in the basket if any. This method is only meant for debugging when you want to test the restocking.
- Added following new Speech parameters for Sellerclasses:
  - `MenuBuy`
  - `MenuSell`
  - `MenuBill`
  - `MenuQuit`
  - `PurchaseCount`
  - `PurchaseCountMult`
  - `EverythingOutOfStock`
