## v1.4.2 - Bug Fix and Improvement

<Callout type="attention" blend="light"> This plugin (update) requires v1.0.5 or higher of [Arcky's Utilities](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19xrRavd1CpbC0p1UQtOUZzuEeHL_WHB5/view?usp=sharing) to function correctly.<br/>

### Bug Fix: 
- Fixed TM Icons not showing in the shelf.

### Improvement:
- Added a new parameter option `BillEnd`. So after checking out, the Saler won't ask if they can help you with anything else but will just say the speech when quiting the mart event.
