## v1.6.0 - Buying Species

<Callout type="attention" blend="light">
  This plugin (update) requires v1.0.9 or higher of [Arcky's Utilities](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19xrRavd1CpbC0p1UQtOUZzuEeHL_WHB5/view?usp=sharing) to function correctly.<br/>
  Once you have installed this, start a new save to avoid malfunction.

### New Feature
- A new type of Store was added which allows the player to buy Species from those shady NPC's.
<br/>
### Improvements
  - renamed Shelf Class parameters:
    <Table 
      headers={["Old name", "", "New name"]} 
      rows={[
        ["ShelfAmountItem", "<=>", "ShelfItemAmount"],
        ["ShelfChangeAmountItem", "<=>", "ShelfItemAmountChange"],
        ["ShelfLimitAmountItem", "<=>", "ShelfItemAmountLimit"],
        ["ShelfIncreaseAmountItem", "<=>", "ShelfItemAmountIncrease"],
        ["ShelfDecreaseAmountItem", "<=>", "ShelfItemAmountDecrease"],
        ["ShelfRemoveAmountItem", "<=>", "ShelfItemAmountRemove"]
      ]}
      alignment={["center", "center", "center"]}
    />
  
  - `ShelfItemAmountdiscount` and `ShelfItemAmountOvercharge` can now use the `new price` and `original price` placeholders.
  - The percentage placeholder used by `ShelfItemAmountdiscount` and `ShelfItemAmountOvercharge` don't add "of" anymore by default.
<br/>
### Bug Fixes 
  - Fixed `buyBonusMult` not being used by the script.
  - Fixed the Item name being singular for `ShelfItemAmount`.
<br/>
### New Settings
- Added a new setting `StockItems` which allows you to more easily manage items and species used by a store.
- Added a new setting `ShowShinySpecies` which allows you to choose if you want species to be shown as shiny or not.
- Added a new setting `BadgesForSpecies` which is actually the same as `BadgesForItems` with exception that it should be only used for Species instead of Items.
