### New Feature
- It is now possible to add more items that give bonus items other than only poke ball items.
<br/>
### Improvements
- Added a new Setting `BonusItems`.
- Added Sound Effects when changing Category Pages.
- Renamed the `CATEGORY_NAMES` Setting to `CategoryNames`.
- Renamed the `CUSTOM_CATEGORY_NAMES` Setting to `CustomCategoryNames`.
- Renamed the `BADGES_FOR_ITEMS` Setting to `BadgesForItems`.
- Renamed the `DISCOUNTS` Setting to `Discounts`.
- When giving Bonus Items but the Bag would be full, this will now be told in the message. it'll either say only a part of the rewared Bonus Items were given or none at all.
- When you would have the max slots used in a pocket in the Bag, but for the Item you want to buy you have x left to fill this slot to the max it can hold, the script will now adjust the maximum buyable items in that case. Before this would be the max amount a slot can hold. Now it would be the amount left for this slot to be full. This will be very rarely a case you'll encounter but it's there when you would need it.
