## v1.3.2 - Changable Currency and Improvements

<Callout type="attention" blend="light"> This plugin (update) requires v1.0.3 or higher of [Arcky's Utilities](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19xrRavd1CpbC0p1UQtOUZzuEeHL_WHB5/view?usp=sharing) to function correctly.<br/>
Once you have installed this, start a new save to avoid malfunction.</Callout>

### New Feature:
- It is now possible to set the currency you want to be used at the shop. This can either be `"Money/Gold"` (default), `"Coins"` (like in the Game Corner) or `"Battle Points/BP"` (like in the Battle Frontier). If you want a different currency just let me know and I'll add it in a future update.
<br/>
### Bug Fixes:
- Fixed a crash when selling items.
- Fixed a bug with the Seller saying the wrong speech after canceling choosing how many of an item you want to buy.
- Fixed restocking items not working as it should.
<br/>
### Improvements:
- Checked the compatibility with the [Bag Screen with interactable Party](https://eeveeexpo.com/resources/723/) Plugin by DiegoWT.
- Added compatibility with the [BW Pok√©Mart Screen](https://eeveeexpo.com/resources/904/) Plugin by DeepBlue. (check [BW Mart Screen](settings/bw-pokemart-screen) on how to install and use it correctly with this plugin.)
